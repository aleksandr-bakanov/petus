They are told of the Protector without followers — a mage who founded no order, wrote no treatises, and sought no recognition, but in his hour of need stood between the living and death.\n\nBefore difficult spells, young mages place their hand momentarily on the cold stone of the wall and whisper his name — not as a prayer, but as a reminder: true magic serves not glory, but choice.";

No one calls it a tradition — it’s simply done when they remember.\nThey say he fought not for victory, but so that others would have time to escape, and therefore his sword shouldn’t be visible — it should rest.\n\nSometimes, on rainy days, a lantern is lit near the crypt.

Travelers quietly pick it up on the road when the evening grows too long. No one calls it the memory of a hero — it’s simply a song that comes to them.\n\nAnd on clear nights, when the moon hangs low, some swear the wind suddenly begins to sound smoother and warmer.

It bears no names or inscriptions: everyone knows to whom it’s dedicated. On the opening day, the dwarves of the Ash Caves stood in a circle and silently struck the ground with their hammers. No songs, no speeches — only a dull, heavy sound that shook the stones.\n\nSince then, they say: if the city gates suddenly become quieter than usual, it means someone has stopped at the anvil and remembered the one who once stayed so others could leave.";

Spells became increasingly difficult, sleep brought only fog, and his own reflection inspired fear. He tried to fight, sought healing, but realized that some distortions could not be reversed.\n\nOne day, he left alone, leaving no farewells.

He left alone, without words or witnesses, to reclaim what he considered rightfully his.\n\nBut when he returned to the pass, he was already broken: doubt dulled his hand, fatigue weighed his steps, and rage proved weaker than stone.\n\nHe didn’t last five minutes.\n\nNow the giant wears his cloak, draped over his shoulder like a warm cloth. He doesn’t know it’s a trophy, doesn’t understand its significance — and in this final humiliation, the warrior’s honor dissolved completely, becoming nothing more than the wind on the pass.";

They came in his dreams, interrupted his thoughts, compelled him to sing even when he was silent. His music became strange: it contained a melancholy that made the listeners’ hearts clench, and a call that made them want to go — not knowing where.\n\nHe resisted to the last, but one day he realized he could no longer distinguish his own desires from those whispered by the forest. On a windless night, he left his house and walked into the thicket, following the voices that now sounded like a sentence.\n\nSince then, a wordless song is sometimes heard in the Forest of Singing Winds — uneven, broken.

Then they sprouted: scarlet veins appeared beneath his skin, his bones grew heavier, his movements slower but stronger.\n\nWhen he realized he could no longer distinguish his own will from the call of the earth, it was too late. He removed his hammer, left it at the entrance, and went deeper into the caves, where fire and stone never sleep.\nThey say that now in the Ash Caves, a mechanism that no one has ever set in motion sometimes moves, and in its rhythm one can hear the heavy breathing of one who has chosen to merge with the earth forever.";

In a single instant, the darkness recoiled: rooftops blazed with cold brilliance, the well’s wooden beam flashed like steel, and sharp black shadows slashed across the earth.\n\nIt was not merely light — it was the cry of a dying sun, forged into a blinding crown of fire.

Within its belly, an unseen force hummed softly — like a captive star bound obediently within iron ribs.\n\nMassive supports, like the legs of a colossal guardian, pierced the earth, leaving faintly smoking marks in the grass from its recent landing. Along its sides protruded cylinders and structures — perhaps vessels of arcane ether, perhaps the organs of some mechanical beast unknown to humankind. Amber lights flickered beneath its hull, like the breathing of a dragon fallen asleep among fields and windmills.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of blue mountains and a tranquil sky, it seemed a messenger from distant constellations — a wanderer descending into a realm of thatched roofs and pastoral calm.

The flash tore through the cosmic night — an overwhelming surge of gamma and X-ray radiation ripping through space as if the very fabric of reality had fractured.\n\nThe shockwave, expanding at thousands of kilometers per second, hurled layers of incandescent plasma into the vacuum. Swirling currents of ionized gas formed a radiant ring — the advancing front of matter enriched with heavy elements forged in the star’s final fractions of a second. Within this blazing cloud, gold, uranium, and other rare atoms were synthesized — the raw material for future planets and civilizations.\nAs the brilliance slowly began to fade, a сверхdense remnant remained behind — a neutron star or a nascent black hole.

It looks like a living lava: a dome-shaped form rises at the center, with wave-like flows spreading outward, as if the liquid is in constant motion.

To them, flesh is but clay and bone a mere framework, waiting to be imbued with a semblance of life by pouring ethereal energy — heavy as quicksilver — into cold, stagnant veins.\n\nIn the eyes of a necromant, the world is drained of color but teeming with shadows and echoes. Mastery is measured by sheer will: should one show a flicker of weakness or fear, the risen dead—driven only by hunger and residual malice — will turn their skeletal fingers upon their creator. The highest manifestation of power is not the raising of rotting hordes, but the ability to command an ancient wraith to divulge secrets of forgotten eras with a mere whisper, all while clinging to one’s own fading humanity.\n\nThe price of such dominion is always etched upon the mage’s visage: pallid skin, frost clinging to the fingertips, and a gaze fixed upon the infinite «nothing». Where an ordinary person sees only an end and decay, the master of necromancy sees an unfinished symbiosis, where death becomes just another stage of service. It is a path of solitude and eternal chill, where the only faithful companions are those who can no longer betray — for they are already dead.";

With every deep breath, the boundaries of the self expand, blurring the line between flesh and ether, until the heartbeat synchronizes with the very rhythm of the earth.\n\nAt the peak of concentration, the world freezes like a fly trapped in honeyed amber. The master perceives mana flows invisible to the common eye, drifting through space, and senses the vibrations of others’ intentions long before they take shape. In this state of absolute stillness, the mind becomes like the mirrored surface of a mountain lake: it reflects the truth without distortion, remaining motionless even if a stone of rage or a blade of doubt is cast into its depths.\n\nThe highest tier of this art allows one to draw power from the Void itself. Shrouded in an aura of serenity, the meditator becomes an unshakeable pillar of existence, capable of mending wounds of spirit and body through sheer force of will. For such a master, time transforms into an obedient river and silence into a formidable weapon, for she who has fathomed her own depths gains dominion over reality without lifting a finger.";
