	<string name="ItemDescMemoryOfMage">In the kingdom, the legendary mage’s name is not spoken aloud in haste. He was inscribed in the Book of Royal Archmages not with gold ink, but with black — the mark of those who gave their lives, leaving behind no school, disciples, or heirs, to save the world itself.\n\nIn the mage towers, students begin their training with the same legend. They are told of the Protector without followers — a mage who founded no order, wrote no treatises, and sought no recognition, but in his hour of need stood between the living and death.\n\nBefore difficult spells, young mages place their hand momentarily on the cold stone of the wall and whisper his name — not as a prayer, but as a reminder: true magic serves not glory, but choice.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescMemoryOfWarrior">The legendary warrior’s sacrifice is spoken of simply in the kingdom, without lofty words.\n\nHis sword was returned to its source — the family crypt — and it wasn’t the priests or military leaders who insisted on this, but the common people.\n\nPeasants, merchants, and artisans leave small tokens of gratitude at the crypt entrance: a broken horseshoe, a piece of leather, a bundle of grain. No one calls it a tradition — it’s simply done when they remember.\nThey say he fought not for victory, but so that others would have time to escape, and therefore his sword shouldn’t be visible — it should rest.\n\nSometimes, on rainy days, a lantern is lit near the crypt. Not in honor of the hero, but so that the path home will always be illuminated, even if you never return.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescMemoryOfBard">The memory of the legendary bard lives in the kingdom not in stone or in books, but in voices.\nHis song has long since lost its words — everyone sings it in their own way, humming only fragments of a melody that cannot be captured in its entirety. But that’s how it’s passed on: not precisely, but vividly.\n\nChildren hum it as they play on the thresholds of houses, unaware of its origin. Travelers quietly pick it up on the road when the evening grows too long. No one calls it the memory of a hero — it’s simply a song that comes to them.\n\nAnd on clear nights, when the moon hangs low, some swear the wind suddenly begins to sound smoother and warmer. And if you listen closely, it seems as if someone is singing nearby — not for glory or reward, but so that the road doesn’t seem empty.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescMemoryOfSmith">The memory of the legendary blacksmith doesn’t resound loudly in the kingdom — it weighs heavily.\nHis hammer was returned to the forge of his hometown and hung by the hearth where he once worked. It’s no longer used to forge weapons, but it’s never removed: the fire in that forge has never gone out for a single night since.\n\nA monument was erected at the capital’s gates — a stone anvil, crude and simple. It bears no names or inscriptions: everyone knows to whom it’s dedicated. On the opening day, the dwarves of the Ash Caves stood in a circle and silently struck the ground with their hammers. No songs, no speeches — only a dull, heavy sound that shook the stones.\n\nSince then, they say: if the city gates suddenly become quieter than usual, it means someone has stopped at the anvil and remembered the one who once stayed so others could leave.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescCurseOfMage">Few know that the mage’s curse began in the Misty Gorge. One of the illusions, not completely dispelled, touched his face — and from then on, half of his features seemed to have a life of their own: reflected in glass incorrectly, whispering other people’s thoughts, remembering things that never happened.\n\nOver time, madness slowly began to consume him from within. Spells became increasingly difficult, sleep brought only fog, and his own reflection inspired fear. He tried to fight, sought healing, but realized that some distortions could not be reversed.\n\nOne day, he left alone, leaving no farewells. He was last seen at the edge of the Misty Gorge, where illusions never completely dissipate.\nThey say that now, among the shadows, one can discern a figure with a half-familiar face — it does not attack or call, only stares, as if still trying to remember who it was.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescCurseOfWarrior">The warrior’s curse was born not of magic, but of a choice denied.\nAt Stone Pass, he was prevented from confronting the giant — and this decision, made out of caution, left a rift deeper than any wound.\n\nHonor, unrequited, began to rot. He left alone, without words or witnesses, to reclaim what he considered rightfully his.\n\nBut when he returned to the pass, he was already broken: doubt dulled his hand, fatigue weighed his steps, and rage proved weaker than stone.\n\nHe didn’t last five minutes.\n\nNow the giant wears his cloak, draped over his shoulder like a warm cloth. He doesn’t know it’s a trophy, doesn’t understand its significance — and in this final humiliation, the warrior’s honor dissolved completely, becoming nothing more than the wind on the pass.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescCurseOfBard">The bard’s curse began in the Forest of Singing Winds, where he once dared to respond to the songs of the dryads. They managed to break through further, but the forest did not completely release him — part of the melody wove itself into his voice, leaving an alien rhythm within him.\n\nOver time, the songs ceased to be quiet. They came in his dreams, interrupted his thoughts, compelled him to sing even when he was silent. His music became strange: it contained a melancholy that made the listeners’ hearts clench, and a call that made them want to go — not knowing where.\n\nHe resisted to the last, but one day he realized he could no longer distinguish his own desires from those whispered by the forest. On a windless night, he left his house and walked into the thicket, following the voices that now sounded like a sentence.\n\nSince then, a wordless song is sometimes heard in the Forest of Singing Winds — uneven, broken. And those who recognize the human voice in it try to leave quickly: they say the forest sings through the one who once tried to answer it.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescCurseOfSmith">The blacksmith’s curse began in the Ash Caves, when he found red crystals, warm as life, amid the slag and rusty machinery. He mistook them for a rare ore and began studying them, testing their sound and impact, without noticing how they began to respond to him.\n\nAt first, the crystals merely drove him mad — distorting time, making him hear meaningful words in the grinding of gears. Then they sprouted: scarlet veins appeared beneath his skin, his bones grew heavier, his movements slower but stronger.\n\nWhen he realized he could no longer distinguish his own will from the call of the earth, it was too late. He removed his hammer, left it at the entrance, and went deeper into the caves, where fire and stone never sleep.\nThey say that now in the Ash Caves, a mechanism that no one has ever set in motion sometimes moves, and in its rhythm one can hear the heavy breathing of one who has chosen to merge with the earth forever.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescStarSupernova">Night wrapped the village in thick velvet, and only a few fading window lights dared to rival the stars. The sky hung low and silent, as if holding its breath.\n\nAnd then one of the stars flared.\n\nAt first, it was no more than a spark lost among the silver scatter of lights. Then its radiance began to swell with unnatural force, as though a fiery rift had opened in the very heart of the heavens. In a single instant, the darkness recoiled: rooftops blazed with cold brilliance, the well’s wooden beam flashed like steel, and sharp black shadows slashed across the earth.\n\nIt was not merely light — it was the cry of a dying sun, forged into a blinding crown of fire. The sky blossomed in orange flame, and for a fleeting moment it seemed that eternity itself had looked down upon the quiet village.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescClotOfMagic">It hovered in the air, touching neither earth nor wind — a cluster of pure magic, radiating a soft yet unbearably deep light. Its surface flowed like living quicksilver, shimmering in shades of azure, gold, and a faint violet flame. Within it, tiny sparks flared and faded, as though stars were being born and extinguished in a sky too small for infinity.\n\nA quiet hum emanated from it, like the echo of a distant choir chanting ancient words long forgotten. The air around it thickened and trembled, grass bent low, and shadows stretched toward it as if drawn to a source of life. To come near was to feel your skin prickle, as though the very fabric of the world brushed against you with unseen fingers.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescSpaceship">It towered above the village like a steel giant strayed from another world. Its matte-silver hull, traced with seams, resembled the armor of an ancient titan, while the rounded cockpit with its dark glass dome gleamed like an enchanted eye. Within its belly, an unseen force hummed softly — like a captive star bound obediently within iron ribs.\n\nMassive supports, like the legs of a colossal guardian, pierced the earth, leaving faintly smoking marks in the grass from its recent landing. Along its sides protruded cylinders and structures — perhaps vessels of arcane ether, perhaps the organs of some mechanical beast unknown to humankind. Amber lights flickered beneath its hull, like the breathing of a dragon fallen asleep among fields and windmills.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of blue mountains and a tranquil sky, it seemed a messenger from distant constellations — a wanderer descending into a realm of thatched roofs and pastoral calm. In its silhouette lingered ancient power and silent mystery, as though it carried legends of worlds where the heavens are roads and the stars serve as lanterns for travelers.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescSupernovaInSpace">At the heart of the abyssal darkness, a star reached the limit of its nuclear endurance. Its core, compressed to an almost impossible density, collapsed in an instant and then unleashed energy rivaling the luminosity of an entire galaxy. The flash tore through the cosmic night — an overwhelming surge of gamma and X-ray radiation ripping through space as if the very fabric of reality had fractured.\n\nThe shockwave, expanding at thousands of kilometers per second, hurled layers of incandescent plasma into the vacuum. Swirling currents of ionized gas formed a radiant ring — the advancing front of matter enriched with heavy elements forged in the star’s final fractions of a second. Within this blazing cloud, gold, uranium, and other rare atoms were synthesized — the raw material for future planets and civilizations.\nAs the brilliance slowly began to fade, a сверхdense remnant remained behind — a neutron star or a nascent black hole. Space around it warped under extreme gravity, and for eons the surrounding galaxy would carry the echo of the catastrophe. It was not merely an explosion, it was a cosmic act of matter recycling, rewriting the chemical map of the Universe.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescAlienEgg">Transparent cylindrical capsule with metallic end caps. The glass body reveals its contents — inside, a bright orange-golden substance pulses, emitting a soft glow. The light reflects off the inner walls of the capsule, creating a sense of warmth and contained energy.\n\nInside the capsule is something resembling an alien organism. It looks like a living lava: a dome-shaped form rises at the center, with wave-like flows spreading outward, as if the liquid is in constant motion. Tiny sparkling points are visible throughout the mass, like microscopic flashes of energy.\n\nThe organism appears active and almost intelligent — its surface shimmers and seems to respond to its surroundings.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescAbilityNecromancy">Necromancy is not merely the magic of death — it is a brazen defiance of time itself and the laws of the universe. A true master does not brandish a staff wildly but conducts a faint, whispered dialogue with the void, feeling for the thin threads of fading souls within the frozen haze of the Veil. To them, flesh is but clay and bone a mere framework, waiting to be imbued with a semblance of life by pouring ethereal energy — heavy as quicksilver — into cold, stagnant veins.\n\nIn the eyes of a necromant, the world is drained of color but teeming with shadows and echoes. Mastery is measured by sheer will: should one show a flicker of weakness or fear, the risen dead—driven only by hunger and residual malice — will turn their skeletal fingers upon their creator. The highest manifestation of power is not the raising of rotting hordes, but the ability to command an ancient wraith to divulge secrets of forgotten eras with a mere whisper, all while clinging to one’s own fading humanity.\n\nThe price of such dominion is always etched upon the mage’s visage: pallid skin, frost clinging to the fingertips, and a gaze fixed upon the infinite «nothing». Where an ordinary person sees only an end and decay, the master of necromancy sees an unfinished symbiosis, where death becomes just another stage of service. It is a path of solitude and eternal chill, where the only faithful companions are those who can no longer betray — for they are already dead.</string>
	<string name="ItemDescAbilityMeditation">Mastery of meditation is not merely a silencing of the mind, but the art of taming an internal storm. While the common man drowns in the chaos of his own thoughts, the true practitioner erects an impregnable citadel within the halls of the soul. With every deep breath, the boundaries of the self expand, blurring the line between flesh and ether, until the heartbeat synchronizes with the very rhythm of the earth.\n\nAt the peak of concentration, the world freezes like a fly trapped in honeyed amber. The master perceives mana flows invisible to the common eye, drifting through space, and senses the vibrations of others’ intentions long before they take shape. In this state of absolute stillness, the mind becomes like the mirrored surface of a mountain lake: it reflects the truth without distortion, remaining motionless even if a stone of rage or a blade of doubt is cast into its depths.\n\nThe highest tier of this art allows one to draw power from the Void itself. Shrouded in an aura of serenity, the meditator becomes an unshakeable pillar of existence, capable of mending wounds of spirit and body through sheer force of will. For such a master, time transforms into an obedient river and silence into a formidable weapon, for she who has fathomed her own depths gains dominion over reality without lifting a finger.</string>

	<string name="NecronomiconStage3DogDialog">I do not know anything but we could investigate, bring me something from there.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage3DogDialogAnswerOption0">Ok, I will see what I can find</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage5AnswerOption0">Look what I have found near the grave</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage5DogDialog">Hmm, interesting, let me see where it will lead me…</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage6AnswerOption0">Have you found anything?</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage6DogDialog">No, not yet, but I am searching.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog0">Look, I have found this strange book on ritual site. Take it.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7AnswerOption0">Thanks, do you know who can help me with it?</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog1">Try to ask catus they usually more experienced in wisdom stuff, the older the better.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog2">One more thing, at the same ritual site I have found the body of the lost pet. Poor guy. Do not worry I will return him back to his grave.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8AnswerOption0">[Show the book] Do you know anything about this book?</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8Dialog0">What is this? I can sense some magic but I am not sure…</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8Dialog1">Ahh, yes, I know what it is. This is Necronomicon. Very dangerous stuff, I recommend to destroy it right away, nothing good will come from it. However I can also teach you how to use it. Your choice. So do you want to use it or destroy it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer0">Hey buddy, I have noticed you barely touch your food, what is going on?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Dialog0">Yeah, you know what, I think I want some fish, could you catch me some? There is a lake nearby I think you can try there.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer1">All right, let us see what I can do. I think I will come up with something on next day.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer0">Oi mate, here is fish you have asked for. From very same lake you described.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Dialog0">Cheers mate, that is what I am talking about! Real fresh fish, el belissimo! Now I know this lake is good, think I will spend some time there by myself. Thanks again!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer1">No problem!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer0">Hey, what is that you are playing with?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Dialog0">Ah, found it on the lake. Round and rolling! Also smells like slime but it is okay. Here, take it, I am done playing with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer1">Thank you, I think I know what to do with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer0">Hey, do you know where all the eggs went?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog0">Wow! I do not know anything about this, but I can look for it, ask me tomorrow, maybe I will find something.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog1">I do not know anything and, honestly, I do not care.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer1">Thank you, I will come see you tomorrow!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Answer0">Well, did you find anything?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Dialog0">Nope, still looking.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage4Dialog0">Aha, I found all the eggs, well, you made me run! I suspect that they just rolled away or maybe the wind blew them away, I put them back in place, now they definitely will not roll away.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Answer0">The eggs are missing again, do you know anything about it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog0">What, again? Oh my! Okay, I will look again, but after I find it, you better come up with something so that this does not happen again.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog1">Ahahahahahahahaha! Seriously? Well, screw them.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Dialog0">Here they are, finally. Listen, I do not want to run around looking for the missing eggs again if something else happens to them. Ask someone else, maybe they can help, we need to solve this problem somehow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Answer0">Okay, I will ask around.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Answer0">Maybe you know what to do with these constantly rolling eggs?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog0">Hmm, I do not know how to help you with this, but I think I know someone who knows what to do. My friends from the pond, handy guys. I will ask them, come see me tomorrow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog1">I told you to ask someone else, do we all look the same to you?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog2">Well, do I look like someone who can control the wind?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Answer0">Well, have you heard from your friends?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Dialog0">They said they would do everything in the best possible way, wait a little longer.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Dialog0">Yes! Look what they just sent us - a beautiful, reliable basket for storing eggs (with a lid). And along with the basket they sent a Bober egg - lucky!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Answer0">Truly a stroke of luck! I will have to try and hatch one or two.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Answer0">I see you have been thinking about something a lot lately, is everything okay?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Dialog0">Yes, everything is fine, I am thinking about one interesting task and want to test it in practice, but I have paws. Will you help me?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Dialog1">Thank you! Then take this two-meter stick and go measure the length of the shoreline of our pond. I am very interested in how much you measure.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Answer1">It will take me one day, I will report the results tomorrow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage3Answer0">Hi, I measured the length of the coast - it was 4.76 kilometers, what is next?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage3Dialog0">Very good, very good. Let us write it down - 4.76 kilometers. Now take this smaller ruler and do the same.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage3Answer1">Okay, I will be back tomorrow with the results.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage5Answer0">So, the survey is complete and some kind of devilry is going on there. This time the length of the coast was 5.12 kilometers. How so?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage5Dialog0">That, my dear, is the paradox of the coastline. If you want to know more about it, ask the bobers, they are good not only at carpentry, but also at mathematics.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage5Answer1">That is what I will do.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage6Answer0">Hi, frogus said you could explain the coastline paradox to me.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage6Dialog0">Aaaah, paradoks linii brzegowej? Wiemy, wiemy. Mam o tym bardzo ciekawą książkę. Przeczytaj ją, jest w niej mnóstwo ciekawych rzeczy.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage6Answer1">Thank you very much, I think I will master it overnight.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Answer0">Hey, my head is been buzzing with all sorts of thoughts lately. How do you always stay so rested?</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Dialog0">Ah, well, we Doguses have been learning meditation since childhood. Do you want me to teach you?</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Dialog1">To achieve enlightenment, do this:\n1. Get a Frogus - they know everything there is to know about meditation.\n2. As soon as it hatches, start practicing with it right away.\n3. Practice meditating with it every day.\n4. If you miss even one day, start over.\n5. Finishing 10 exercises will allow you to achieve enlightenment.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Answer1">It sounds confusing, but I will try.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Answer0">Hi, dogus said you can teach me meditation.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Dialog0">Great, you have come to the right place. Let us start with something simple – breathing exercises. Repeat after me.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Dialog1">Sorry, but you are a bit late, you need to find a younger Frogus.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Dialog2">[Half an hour later] Well, that is great, come tomorrow, we will continue training.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Answer0">Hi, I came to continue our training.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog0">You came too early, not even a day has passed since our last training, rest for now.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog1">Excellent! I see you are rested and ready to continue. Exercise for today is</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog2">Unfortunately, you are more than two days late. That is not how things work. We will have to start all over again.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Answer1">Oh, oh, what can you do...</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog4">I have nothing more to teach you, child, you already know everything you need to know. From now on, you can free yourself from the thoughts that bother you at will. Congratulations!</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Answer2">Thank you for spending time with me! I have learned a lot.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage1Answer0">Hi, I have heard some disturbing rumors about the kingdom, do you know what they are all about?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage1Dialog0">The king was looking for you... but I was tasked with speaking. Time is running out, listen carefully. Last night, the necromancer Valherris infiltrated the royal preserve and stole what should have been guarded for centuries — a dragon egg. The necromancer intends to perform a ritual that will transform the dragon hatchling into a soulless creature. If he succeeds, the world awaits times far more terrible than any war. We have five days, no more.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage1Answer1">And what do you want from me?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage1Dialog1">You must assemble a party. Going there alone is certain death. But with the right pets… you have a chance.\n\nListen — you need four:\n- Dogus the warrior, whose strength is like a hammer on an anvil, and whose courage is stronger than steel. He will lead you through any enemy ranks.\n- Catus the mage — Well… that is me. And believe me, without my magic and knowledge of ancient runic paths, you will not get halfway.\n- Frogus the bard — his voice can calm the storm and dispel illusions. You need him not only as a musician — he knows paths hidden from maps.\n- Bober the blacksmith — he is a man of few words, but his hands can repair, destroy, or smelt almost anything. And without him, you will perish in the Ash Caves.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage1Answer2">Four different pets, yep, I get it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage1Dialog2">Return to me when you have gathered them all. Go. Time is our enemy. Find them. Gather a squad. And return the egg... before the world turns to ashes.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage1Answer3">We will definitely cope!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Answer0">I want you to join our team to save the dragon egg.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Dialog0">Are you absolutely sure about this?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Answer1">Yes, I am sure you are the one we need!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Answer2">Wait, I need to think some more.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Dialog1">Okay, I will go collect everything I need.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Answer3">When you are ready, come to Catus mage, we will meet at his place.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Dialog2">Jestem zaszczycony takim zaufaniem! I will speak in a common language, it will be easier. Are you absolutely sure that I am the one you need?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Answer4">Everyone is assembled, we are ready to move out.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Dialog3">Very well, our first goal is to reach the Misty Gorge. The journey there will take about a day, so do not waste your energy, let us get going!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage2Answer5">Adventures await!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage3Answer0">Haven’t we reached the Misty Gorge yet?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage3Dialog0">Not yet, be patient.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage4Answer0">We’ve finally arrived, tell us what’s going on here.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage4Dialog0">We stand at the entrance to a gorge, shrouded in a thick silvery fog. Through it, distant whispers, footsteps, and strange laughter can be heard. The figures in the fog seem to be either human or monsters. I raise my staff, the crystal shimmers with an uncertain light.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage4Dialog1">Be careful. This is no ordinary fog. It’s saturated with the illusions of the ancient spirits of the gorge. It will distort distances, show false paths, make you see things that aren’t there... or things you’d rather not see at all. I sense that without the right approach, we could wander here for hours — or fall into traps.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage4Dialog2">Talk to everyone in the group. We all have our own ideas on how to best get through this place. You’ll have to choose the method that seems most suitable. When you’re ready, let me know your decision.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Answer0">How do you propose to get through the Misty Gorge?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Dialog0">I can dispel some of the spell. Not completely, but enough to reveal the true contours of the path. This is the safest path.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Dialog1">To hell with illusions! It’s all smoke and terror. I’ll lead the way, cutting a path with my sword. If there are phantoms, I’ll chop off their heads. If there are traps, I’ll withstand the blow. We’ll get to the end if we simply move forward, not letting the fog take over our minds.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Dialog2">The gorge sings. Do you hear it? These voices respond to the melody. If I find the right rhythm, I can keep us sane and prevent illusions from penetrating our hearts. We will follow my song — it will become the thread that will lead us out of this nightmare.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Dialog3">Illusions? Hm. We’re not afraid of them if we leave our mark. Look: if I drive iron pegs into the ground every twenty steps, we won’t get lost. And illusions... illusions don’t care where the iron is. The work is time-consuming, but reliable.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Answer1">I have heard all the options and am ready to decide what we will do.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Dialog4">Okay, so what did you decide?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Answer2">I agree with Catus’s proposal.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Answer3">I like Dogus’s idea</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Answer4">Frogus’s solution seems right.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Answer5">I have confidence in Bober’s approach.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Answer6">Actually, let me think a bit more...</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage5Dialog5">Okay, we trust your judgment. We’ll prepare and act according to the chosen plan. If we try, we’ll be done in an hour. Forward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage7Answer0">How did we do?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage7Dialog0">We passed through the fog quickly and safely. At one point, I almost lost my concentration and one of the illusions almost distorted me, but I managed to pull through and led the group under a magical shield. We’re ready to continue our journey, our next destination is the Forest of Singing Winds, a journey that will take a day. Let’s go!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage7Dialog1">As expected, we quickly crossed the gorge. Dogus truly demonstrated his mastery of the sword, though it wasn’t particularly effective. One of the lurking illusions distorted half my face, but I noticed it in time and cast a spell to banish it. We’re ready to continue our journey, our next destination is the Forest of Singing Winds, a journey that will take a day. Let’s go!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage7Dialog2">I didn’t think Frogus’s plan would work, and I was surprised when the ghosts actually began to react to the rhythm of his melody. Not everyone reacted the same way, though — one of the lurking illusions distorted half my face, but I noticed it in time and cast a spell to banish it. We’re ready to continue our journey, our next destination is the Forest of Singing Winds, a journey that will take one day. Let’s go!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage7Dialog3">The Bober’s plan was indeed sound, albeit very slow. We fiddled around for so long that even the ghosts seemed to tire of it all and lost interest. I, too, soon lost interest, and in vain – one of the lurking illusions (which clearly hadn’t lost interest in us) distorted half my face, but I noticed it in time and banished it with a spell. We’re ready to continue on our way, our next destination is the Forest of Singing Winds, a day’s journey away. Onward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage8Answer0">Haven’t we reached the Forest of Singing Winds yet?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage9Answer0">We’ve finally arrived, tell us what’s going on here.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage9Dialog0">We enter an ancient forest. The leaves tremble, though there’s barely a breath of wind. The air is filled with quiet yet eerie melodies — as if someone is singing from everywhere and nowhere at once. The voices grow louder, and the mood shifts strangely: now sudden joy, now melancholy, now a desire to stop and listen.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage9Dialog1">Wait... this is the Forest of Singing Winds. The ancient dryads cast a spell here to repel travelers. These voices affect the mind: they can lull you to sleep, lull you into oblivion, remind you of your most painful memories... We must pass quickly and resist their spell. Otherwise, they will lead us into the thicket, from which no one returns.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage9Dialog2">As before, talk to everyone in the group. We all have our own ideas on how to best get through this place. You’ll have to choose the method that seems most suitable. When you’re ready, let me know your decision.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage10Answer0">How do you propose to get through the Forest of Singing Winds?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage10Answer1">I have heard all the options and am ready to decide what we will do.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage10Dialog0">I can create a sound barrier, cutting off the dryads’ voices from our senses. A sphere of silence around us will allow us to pass more quickly. But it will require concentration... and if I weaken even for a moment, the spell might break through.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage10Dialog1">Spells, voices, songs… it’s all nonsense. If we just stick together and walk straight ahead, ignoring the voices, they won’t do anything to us. We plug our ears and move on. What could be so difficult?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage10Dialog2">Allow me. These melodies are no threat if you know how to respond. I can harmonize with the forest, align its voice with our steps. Then the dryads won’t touch us. I can’t promise the path will be easy... but we’ll remain sane.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage10Dialog3">Songs, whispers… they’re all empty sounds. If we create our own noise — loud, constant, rhythmic — the enemy’s melodies will lose their power. I can pound my hammer on my shield, setting the tempo. It will be unpleasant for everyone, but we will drown out their music.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage12Answer0">How did we do this time?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage12Dialog0">We walked slowly, adjusting to the rhythm of the forest. Frogus certainly knew his stuff — his melody harmonized so well with the forest’s song that, by the end, we heard the dryads’ pleas — they begged us to leave Frogus with them — they liked him so much. It’s a good thing we’d already passed the forest by this time. We are ready to move on, to the Stone Pass, the journey there would take a day. Onward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage12Dialog1">My sound barrier worked, and we truly walked in complete silence. However, towards the end, Frogus admitted that his perfect pitch had indeed picked up the dryads’ melodies — they were asking him to stay with them. Now he’s acting out of sorts and muttering occasionally. Don’t worry, he’ll be fine. We’re ready to move on to Stone Pass, it’ll only take a day. Let’s go!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage12Dialog2">Dogus’s plan was as simple as he was — and it worked! I didn’t expect it, I didn’t expect it. However, in the end, Frogus admitted that his perfect pitch had indeed caught the dryads’ melodies — they were asking him to stay with them. Now he’s acting out of sorts and muttering occasionally. Don’t worry, he’ll be fine. We’re ready to move on to the Stone Pass, it’ll only take a day. Forward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage12Dialog3">It seems Beaver has no understanding of music at all. It was miserable for everyone — us, the forest, and the dryads. In the end, Frogus admitted that his perfect pitch had finally caught the dryads’ melodies — they were asking him to stay with them. Now he’s acting out of sorts and muttering occasionally. Don’t worry, he’ll be fine. We’re ready to move on to Stone Pass, it’ll only take a day. Let’s go!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage13Answer0">Haven’t we reached the Stone Pass yet?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage14Answer0">We’ve finally arrived, tell us what’s going on here.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage14Dialog0">At dawn, we ascend a high-mountain trail. The narrow road passes beneath overhanging cliffs. A huge figure appears on the path — a giant of gray stone, as if carved from the mountain itself.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage14Dialog1">He holds a massive stone club and blocks the way, looking at us with motionless but attentive slit-like eyes.\n\n“Stop. This is my pass,” he says. “No one passes until they prove themselves worthy. Either by strength, or honor, or wisdom. Decide.”</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage14Dialog2">This giant is no simple creature. He is bound by an ancient pact with the mountains: to allow travelers through only after a trial. We must pass, otherwise we’ll have to find a way around… and that would be a waste of an entire day. We need to decide how to convince him. Return to me when you’re ready to make a decision.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage15Answer0">How do you propose to get through the Stone Pass?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage15Answer1">I have heard all the options and am ready to decide what we will do.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage15Dialog0">The giant’s skin is nearly impenetrable, but I have a spell that can blind him momentarily or create the illusion of a detour. We can get through while he’s disoriented. It’s dangerous… but possible.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage15Dialog1">It’s all perfectly clear. He wants a test, so I’ll give him one. I’ll challenge him to a fair fight, one-on-one. No magic, no tricks. If I can withstand his blow or force him to retreat, he’ll let us pass.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage15Dialog2">The giant is a great stone soul, let me turn to the ancient songs. I can soothe him, sing him a ballad of peace and freedom of the paths. Giants respect history and music — perhaps he will allow us to pass willingly, without a fight.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage15Dialog3">The giant is a stone. I am a blacksmith. We speak the same language. Allow me. I will offer to strengthen his club with my iron clamps. Improving the weapon is the best payment. Perhaps he will let us go for the work, without trials.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage17Answer0">How did we manage to defeat the giant?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage17Dialog0">Dogus challenged the giant to a fair duel. Despite the difference in height, our brave warrior was head and shoulders above his opponent in terms of weapon mastery. The giant soon conceded defeat and said he would long remember such a skilled warrior. We passed without delay. Well, it’s time to move on to the Ash Caves. Forward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage17Dialog1">We barely had time to slip past the giant while he was blinded by my spell. Dogus, a true fighter, was displeased that he wasn’t allowed to challenge the giant to a duel, but the main thing is we slipped past without losses. Well, it’s time to head for the Ash Caves. Forward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage17Dialog2">I don’t know whether Frogus made up these legends himself or read them somewhere, but it seems the giant truly enjoyed his stories. At the end, he sat motionless, pensively, gazing into the distance — we realized this was our chance to get through, and we took it. Dogus, however, was dissatisfied with not being allowed to challenge the giant to a duel, but the main thing is we slipped through without losses. Well, time to head for the Ash Caves. Forward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage17Dialog3">I had no idea that Bober had brought along a whole arsenal of tools for upgrading and modernizing weapons in the field. The giant was also taken aback by the offer and, after some consideration, agreed. Bober did a splendid job. Dogus was displeased that he wasn’t allowed to challenge the giant to a duel, especially since, he said, giant now had a more powerful weapon than before! However, the main thing is that we got through without losses. Well, time to move on to the Ash Caves. Forward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage18Answer0">Haven’t we reached the Ash Caves yet?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage19Answer0">We’ve finally arrived, tell us what’s going on here.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage19Dialog0">We descend into dark caves. The walls are covered in runes, and the ground vibrates beneath our feet. Deep below, the clatter of ancient machinery can be heard: the hiss of steam, the rumble of gears, the flashes of lava. Sharp gusts of hot air burst from the side pipes every now and then.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage19Dialog1">As soon as we take a few steps forward, one of the lattice doors slams behind us, forcing us to move only forward.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage19Dialog2">Be careful. These caves are the ancient workshops of the Ash Dwarves. Their technology combines mechanics and fiery runes. One mistake and we’ll end up under lava or trapped. But there’s no turning back. We must get through this scorching labyrinth. You know what to do.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage20Answer0">How do you propose to get through the Ash Caves?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage20Answer1">I have heard all the options and am ready to decide what we will do.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage20Dialog0">I have an idea. If we cool the air around us with ice magic, we can slow down some of the mechanisms. This will create a safe passageway. But fire and ice runes conflict… the consequences are unpredictable.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage20Dialog1">We’re wasting too much time. If we just move quickly, I can get through first and clear the way. Yes, it’s hot in some places, but we can’t stop. We’ll run where the furnaces are active and crawl where it’s too hot.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage20Dialog2">“The toothed wheels started spinning in my head.\nIn my wet head under the armor-piercing rain.”\n\nListen… these mechanisms work in rhythm. Can you hear it? “Knock-knock-shhhh” — repeating every few seconds. If we move to the rhythm, adjusting to the cycle, we can pass between the stoves and doors without coming into contact with the fire. The main thing is not to lose our rhythm.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage20Dialog3">This is my element. I know how these machines work. Give me time — I’ll check the pressure in the pipes, jam the dangerous gears, and shut down the unnecessary furnaces. If we follow me and do as I say, we’ll get through without any losses.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage22Answer0">How did we manage to get through fire, water and copper pipes?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage22Dialog0">We moved very slowly and carefully, Bober checking any suspicious levers and mechanisms with particular care. A couple of times we stumbled upon some red crystals growing out of the walls, which greatly intrigued Bober, but I hurried him on, reminding him that he was responsible for our safety. Overall, we made it out without any casualties. We’re almost there — it’s a day’s journey from here to the ritual site. Onward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage22Dialog1">My plan worked, though it required extreme concentration on my part. Now everyone’s sniffling. In one of the corridors, some red crystals were growing out of the wall, which for some reason caught Bober’s interest. I didn’t have time to dwell on it, he seemed to have grabbed a couple of them, saying he’d study them in more detail later. We’re almost there — it’s a day’s journey from here to the ritual site. Let’s go!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage22Dialog2">Oh, that Dogus! He always thinks everyone around him is as tough as he is. Frogus and I nearly fell into a crevice trying to keep up with our brave warrior. In one of the corridors, some red crystals were growing out of the wall, which for some reason greatly interested Bober. We didn’t have time to dwell on them, he seemed to have grabbed a couple of them, saying he’d study them in more detail later. We’re almost there — it’s a day’s journey from here to the ritual site. Onward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage22Dialog3">Well, that was quite an exercise in rhythm. I had no idea everyone in our group would be such natural dancers. We did lose our rhythm once because of Bober — some red crystals were growing out of the wall in one of the corridors, which for some reason caught his interest. We didn’t have time to dwell on it, but he seemed to have grabbed a couple of them, saying he’d study them in more detail later. We’re almost there — it’s a day’s journey from here to the ritual site. Onward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage23Answer0">Haven’t we reached the ritual site yet?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage24Answer0">We are here, what is going on here?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage24Dialog0">We climb the shattered steps to the ritual chamber. The doors stand open, and an ominous green light pours from within. The air trembles with eerie whispers. In the center of the chamber stands a dragon’s egg, surrounded by runes. Valherris stands above it — tall, in tattered robes, his eyes as empty as night.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage24Dialog1">“It’s too late…” the necromancer says. “You’ve come too late. But if you want to die next to this damned egg, I don’t mind.”\nHe waves his hand, and hordes of minions burst from the shadows: skeleton knights, ghosts, shadows, and bone golems.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage24Dialog2">Valherris, you pathetic fool! Did you think I couldn’t recognize the spell of eternal summoning? You sold your soul in exchange for this final summoning, and your time is numbered! Now we can easily take the egg.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage24Dialog3">But there’s one problem… We’ll get the egg, but the minions will really be spawning forever. Whatever you say, that damn necromancer was incredibly powerful (now all that’s left of him is a robe on the floor). We don’t have much time, we can’t fight forever. One of us has to escape with the egg, and the others will buy him enough time. Decide, who among us will save the egg?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage24Answer1">It seems I have no other choice…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage24Dialog7">But there’s one problem… We’ll get the egg, but the minions will really be spawning forever. Whatever you say, that damn necromancer was incredibly powerful (now all that’s left of him is a robe on the floor). We don’t have much time, we can’t fight forever. I never thought I’d have to resort to the power of the Necronomicon. It’s powerful enough for one of us to hold off the creatures long enough for the others to escape with the egg. Decide which of us will buy the others time?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer0">You will be the one who saves the egg…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer1">I’m ready to make a choice…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog0">Who did you choose?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer2">I choose you, Catus…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer3">I choose Dogus…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer4">I choose Frogus…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer5">I choose Bober…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog1">Are you absolutely sure?</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer6">Yes, I am sure.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer7">Let me think a bit more…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog2">Well, in that case, it’s time to say goodbye. I’m putting Dogus in charge of the team. Talk to him, and I have to go. There’s something I need to sort out…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer8">Goodbye, my friend</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Answer9">Catus put you in charge, tell me what happened</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog3">This is how it happened: Catus grabbed his staff, and a blue flame flared on it.\n\n— Necromancy raised these creatures. Magic will stop them. Go away.\n\nDrawing power from the cursed book, he creates a wall of energy that tears the air. The last thing you hear is his quiet voice:\n\n— It was an honor to walk with you.\n\nThe wall explodes with light, burying the mage and the hordes of the dead.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog4">It’s time to go back, we don’t want his sacrifice to be in vain. The journey home will be easier and quicker, and it will only take one day. Let’s go!</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog6">Dogus places his cloak in your hands — he smiles for the first time in the entire adventure.\n\n— Take the egg. I will hold them back. Go.\n\nTouching the cursed book with his sword, he imbues it with mystical light. Turning, he charges into the ranks of the undead, shouting a battle cry that echoes throughout the hall…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog8">Frogus clutches the lyre to his chest. His eyes are sad, but confident.\n\n— We each have our own song, but the final one is always a solo. Remember me like this... singing.\n\nTouching the cursed book, he raises the lyre and plays a note that cracks the air. The melody cuts through the undead like a blade, and then everything around it. The song fades along with the bard’s life, opening the way for you.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog10">Bober places his hand on your shoulder and looks at you calmly, as if this were all just another day’s work in the forge.\n\n— Iron bends under the hammer. And fate — under the choices we made. Go. I will bring down the halls behind me.\n\nHe waits until we run across the bridge, then, touching the cursed book, strikes the hammer against a supporting column. The entire temple begins to crumble. The last thing we see is Bober’s silhouette standing amidst the falling stones.</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog13">Dogus places his cloak in your hands — he smiles for the first time in the entire adventure. urning, he charges into the ranks of the undead, shouting a battle cry that echoes throughout the hall…</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog14">Frogus clutches the lyre to his chest. His eyes are sad, but confident. He raises the lyre and plays a note that cracks the air. The melody cuts through the undead like a blade, and then everything around it. The song fades along with the bard’s life, opening the way</string>
	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog15">Bober places his hand on your shoulder and looks at you calmly, as if this were all just another day’s work in the forge.

	<string name="ObtainDragonStage25Dialog18">Catus grabs his staff, and a blue flame flares on it. He creates a wall of energy that tears the air. The wall explodes with light, burying the mage and the hordes of the dead.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage1Answer0">Hey… Catus, did you see that? Did the sky just explode?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage1Dialog0">I saw it. And this, my friend, is not just a firework. This is Betelgeuse.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage1Answer1">Betel… who?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage1Dialog1">Betelgeuse. A red supergiant. Once a star, it has decided to make a graceful exit — it has gone supernova. Such an event happens once every few thousand years.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage1Answer2">Sounds epic.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage1Dialog2">Of course. You know what would be really epic? To fly there and see it all with your own eyes.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage1Answer3">Hmm… indeed, why not?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage2Answer0">Bober, hypothetical question. Can you build… a spaceship?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage2Dialog0">Hypothetically? Yes. Practically? Also yes, but with some nuances.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage2Answer1">Which ones exactly?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage2Dialog1">I need a source of powerful magic. You know, concentrated magic. Without it, the ship won’t get further than the next hill.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage2Answer2">Where can I get it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage2Dialog2">At the dragon’s, of course. Where else?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage3Answer0">Hi, we need magic. For a flight to a supernova.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage3Dialog0">Hmm. A bold wish. And a stupid one. I like it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage3Answer1">So… will you help?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage3Dialog1">Take this. This is a clot of pure magic. Don’t drop it. And don’t eat it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage3Answer2">I’ll try.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage4Answer0">Hi, I brought a little magic.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage4Dialog0">Ooh, that’s some magic! Okay… if it’s here, then the stabilizer, and the magic engine…</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage4Answer1">I see you are passionate about work, when will the starship be ready?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage4Dialog1">Tomorrow, come tomorrow… I wonder if this formula will work…</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage6Answer0">Hey, how are things with the starship?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage6Dialog0">It worked! Everything is according to plan. All systems are operating normally. The magical spaceship is ready. Onward, to the stars!</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage6Answer1">Onward!</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage8Answer0">Hello… we’ve been flying for a long time, and Betelgeuse is still far away.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage8Dialog0">Well, space is big.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage8Answer1">Something’s wrong here…</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage9Answer0">Hi, do you know why we’re flying so slowly?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage9Dialog0">I see your path. It is… ineffective.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage9Answer1">In terms of?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage9Dialog1">You are flying at normal thrust. Your hyperdrive is turned off.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage9Answer2">…what?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage10Answer0">Bober.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage10Dialog0">Yes?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage10Answer1">Did we forget to turn on the hyperdrive?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage10Dialog2">Yeah, heck… wait a second…</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage10Answer2">Bober, bober…</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage11Answer0">Wow…</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage11Dialog0">Supernova remnants. Gas, light, debris… beautiful. And deadly.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage11Answer1">Wait. Do you see this?</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage11Dialog1">Signal? Yes. In orbit. Looks like a capsule.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage11Answer2">Launch the probe. It should return within an hour.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage13Answer0">The probe has returned with the capsule, it’s time to go home.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage13Dialog0">Hyperdrive engaged. This time, immediately. The journey home will take one hour.</string>
	<string name="ObtainAlienStage13Answer1">Excellent. I hope no one at home is against alien capsules.</string>

	<string name="QuestNameObtainDragon">Dragon age</string>
	<string name="QuestNameObtainAlien">Betel… who?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage0">Something tells me I need to make sure I understand the catus one hundred percent.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage1">Great, now I need to ask adult catus, maybe someone needs some help.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage2">As I thought, one of the katus asked me to diversify the menu and find some fish somewhere. I will look for it near the pond he was talking about.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage3">Well, I caught some fish, I should give it to the catus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage4">Catus was pleased with my offering and said that he would go to the pond himself and evaluate its potential.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage5">I should probably ask Catus about his assessment of the pond.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage6">Well, the pond assessment turned out to be very successful, he even found a Frogus egg, which I am incredibly happy about.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand dogus and catus. And wait for something wicked this way comes.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage1">Here comes another beautiful day.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage2">Nothing foreshadows trouble.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage3">Oh no! Someone dug up the grave without the consent of the deceased’s closest relatives! I need to ask around, maybe someone knows something.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage4">Dogus asked me to bring something from the grave so that he could begin his search.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage5">I found a piece of fabric, I need to show it to the dogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage6">Dogus said that he would try to follow the trail.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage7">I should ask the dogus if he found anything.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage8">I learned that catus are knowledgeable in magic. And the longer they live, the better they understand it. Perhaps one of them can help me with this mysterious book.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage9Use">The old catus told me that the book that dogus found was the Necronomicon. He also warned me that it was a very dangerous book. However, I decided to ignore him and wanted to learn the knowledge that this book contains. It seems that now I can resurrect the dead.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage9Destroy">The old katus told me that the book that the dogus found was the Necronomicon. He also warned me that it was a very dangerous book. Taking his advice, I decided to destroy the book. To be on the safe side.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand %1$s and dogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage1">The eggs are gone! The eggs are gone! What should I do?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage2">I will ask the pets, maybe they know something.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage3">Dogus agreed to look for the eggs and said to give him a day to do it.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage4">It seems it’s time to ask the dogus about the results of his search.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage5">Dogus successfully returned the eggs to their place, now nothing will happen to them.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage6">The eggs are gone again! What the hell is going on! Maybe someone else can help me?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage7">Dogus agreed to help me again and told me to think about solving the problem in the future.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage8">Perhaps it’s time to ask the dogus about the search results again.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage9">Dogus put all the eggs back in place. I really should ask the other pets to help me with this.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage10">Frogus said that he would ask his friends from the pond, he said that they are handy and know their business.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage11">It’s time to ask frogus if there is any news from his friends.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage12">Wow! These Bober guys not only gave me a basket for eggs, but they also entrusted me with one of their eggs so that I could care for future generations of bobers.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand %1$s and %2$s.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage1">I have noticed that lately the froguses have been sitting in thought for a long time, I need to figure out what is going on.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage2">Frogus asked me to measure the length of the pond shoreline using a two-meter stick. Why would he want that?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage3">Well, I have measured it, it is time to report the results.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage4">Now frogus asked me to do the same thing, but with a different ruler.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage5">This time I measured a completely different number. Strange, I will go ask frogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage6">Frogus sent me to the bobers to find out about this paradox.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage7">Bober gave me a book about mathematics, I will dive into it head first.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage8">Wow, I learned a lot of new things there! What I liked most in this book were the fractals, now I know what they are and how different they are. I love imagining them!</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand %1$s and dogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage1">My head is been spinning lately. I will ask the adult dogus how he always manages to stay so rested.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage2">Dogus told me to ask Frogus about meditation.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage3">We started intensive training with Frogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage4">I learned meditation practices and now I can forget anything I want!</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand catus, %1$s, dogus and %2$s.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage1">I heard some rumors about troubles in the kingdom, I think I will ask Catus about it.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage2">So, to save the egg I need to assemble a team of Catus, Dogus, Frogus and Bober.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage3">We set off for our first destination, Misty Gorge, which will take one day to get there.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage4">We have arrived at the Misty Gorge, how do we get through it?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage5">I should ask the group how they propose to cross the Misty Gorge and choose the best option.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage6">I’ve made a decision on how to get through the Misty Gorge, and I hope it’s the right one.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage7">We’ve made it to the other side of the Misty Gorge, I need to find out from Catus about the team’s status.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage8">We are moving towards the next location - the Forest of Singing Winds.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage9">We have arrived at the Forest of Singing Winds, how do we get through it?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage10">I should ask the group how they propose to cross the Forest of Singing Winds and choose the best option.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage11">I’ve made a decision on how to get through the Forest of Singing Winds, and I hope it’s the right one.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage12">We passed through the forest, I’ll ask Catus how successfully we did it.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage13">We move on - the Stone Pass awaits us.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage14">We have arrived at the Stone Pass, what danger awaits us here?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage15">I should ask the group how they propose to cross the Stone Pass and choose the best option.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage16">I’ve made a decision on how to get through the Stone Pass, and I hope it’s the right one.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage17">It looks like we’ve overcome the giant, I’ll find out the details from Catus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage18">We move on - the Ash Caves awaits us.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage19">We have arrived at the Ash Caves, what danger awaits us here?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage20">I should ask the group how they propose to cross the Ash Caves and choose the best option.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage21">I’ve made a decision on how to get through the Ash Caves, and I hope it’s the right one.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage22">We got through the caves, I’ll ask Catus how we did.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage23">We’re almost there - to the ritual site!</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage24">We arrived at the site of the final battle.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage25YesNecro">The necromancer is defeated, but now I have to choose who will buy time for the others.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage25NoNecro">The necromancer is defeated, but now I must choose who will escape with the egg while the others hold off the creatures.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage26">We got the egg back, but at what cost! Time to go home.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainDragonStage27">Here we are at home, time to honor the memory of the heroes and start hatching dragons!</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand catus, %1$s, %2$s and %3$s.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage1">A new star has appeared in the sky, I need to find out from Catus what’s what.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage2">Catus explained that this was Betelgeuse and suggested flying to it, I should ask Bober if this is even possible.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage3">The Bober said that he could build a spaceship, but to do so he needed concentrated magic, which could be taken from dragons.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage4">I got magic from the dragon (I’ll try not to eat it), I need to give it to the bober.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage5">I gave the bober a clot of magic and he immersed himself in work, saying to come tomorrow.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage6">Need to ask the bober about the starship.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage7">The starship is ready! We’re heading to Betelgeuse. According to the panels, we’re still %1$s days away.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage8">It’s taking us a strangely long time to fly, even with dragon magic. Need to ask bober what’s wrong.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage9">I need to consult with the fractal, maybe it will tell me what to do.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage10">So. It seems the bober got so busy that he forgot the most important thing.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage11">We’ve arrived. It’s very beautiful. I’ll go ask the beaver if everything is okay.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage12">We launched a probe to intercept the capsule sending out a strange signal.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage13">The probe has brought the capsule on board. Need to tell the bober it’s time to return.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage14">We’re flying home.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainAlienStage15">We’re back home, time to try growing this weird soup.</string>

	<!-- Random facts about pets -->
	<string name="FactDog1">A dog’s nose print is as unique as a human fingerprint. It can be used by forensic investigators to identify specific animals.</string>
	<string name="FactDog2">Dogs have three eyelids in each eye. The third lid, called the nictitating membrane, helps keep the eye lubricated and protected.</string>
	<string name="FactDog3">Bloodhounds have a sense of smell so accurate that it is admissible as evidence in a court of law. They can follow tracks that are over 300 hours old.</string>
	<string name="FactDog4">Your dog’s sense of smell is roughly 10,000 to 100,000 times more acute than yours. If you can smell a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee, they can smell a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.</string>
	<string name="FactDog5">Dogs have about 1,700 taste buds, while humans have around 9,000. This is why they are often more interested in how food smells than how it actually tastes.</string>
	<string name="FactDog6">A dog’s whiskers are packed with nerves that send sensory information to the brain. These «vibrissae» help them detect subtle changes in air currents and navigate in the dark.</string>

	<string name="FactCat78">Cats are very good at hiding pain. In the wild, showing weakness would make them a target for larger predators.</string>
	<string name="FactCat79">The phrase «the cat’s pajamas» was coined in the 1920s to describe something cool. It was part of a trend of nonsense phrases involving animals.</string>
	<string name="FactCat80">Some cats are «polydactyl», meaning they are born with extra toes. Ernest Hemingway famously loved these cats, and his estate in Key West is still full of them.</string>
	<string name="FactCat81">Cats have a «mirror neuron» system. This suggests they might be able to feel empathy or at least mimic the emotions of their owners.</string>
	<string name="FactCat82">If a cat’s whiskers are touched, it can trigger a «blink» reflex. This is a defensive measure to protect the eyes from potential debris.</string>
	<string name="FactCat83">Cats have a very short-term memory for things that don’t matter, but an incredible long-term memory for locations. They can find their way home from miles away.</string>
	<string name="FactCat84">The «scruff» of a cat’s neck has a special neurological trigger. When a mother cat picks up a kitten there, the kitten instinctively goes limp and calm.</string>
	<string name="FactCat85">Cats use their whiskers to judge if the air is moving. This helps them navigate rooms even if they can’t see anything at all.</string>
	<string name="FactCat86">A cat’s purr is often compared to a «lullaby» for themselves. They use it to lower their blood pressure and stay calm in stressful situations.</string>
	<string name="FactCat87">Cats can tell when you are about to go on a trip. They recognize the «suitcase ritual» and often sit inside the bag to prevent you from leaving.</string>
	<string name="FactCat88">When a cat is «chattering» at a bird through a window, it’s an instinctual jaw movement. They are practicing the «killing bite» they would use to snap the bird’s neck.</string>
	<string name="FactCat89">Cats have a sense of time. They know exactly when you are supposed to be home and will often wait by the door.</string>
	<string name="FactCat90">A cat’s field of vision is 200 degrees. This is 20 degrees wider than a human’s, giving them a slight advantage in detecting motion.</string>

	<string name="FactCat94">Cats don’t see the world in black and white, but they don’t see colors as vibrantly as we do. They mostly see shades of blue and green.</string>
	<string name="FactCat95">If you keep your cat indoors, they can live up to three times longer than outdoor cats. This is due to a lack of predators, cars, and diseases.</string>
	<string name="FactCat96">Cats have a «homing» ability called magnetoreception. They use the Earth’s magnetic field to help them find their way back to their territory.</string>
	<string name="FactCat97">A cat’s skin is very loose. This is a defense mechanism that allows them to turn and bite a predator even if they are being held by the neck.</string>
	<string name="FactCat98">Cats can be trained to perform tricks, much like dogs. However, they require much more «bribe» (treats) and have a significantly shorter attention span.</string>
	<string name="FactCat99">The «cat’s meow» isn’t just a sound, it’s a manipulation. Studies suggest cats have evolved their meows to mimic the frequency of a human baby’s cry.</string>
	<string name="FactCat100">Cats believe they own the house, and you are just the staff. If you’ve ever owned a cat, you know this isn’t a «weird fact» — it’s the absolute truth.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog1">The Wood Frog is a literal popsicle. It can freeze up to 65% of its body water during winter and thaw out perfectly fine in the spring.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog2">Glass Frogs are living X-rays. Their abdominal skin is completely transparent, allowing you to watch their heart beat and their last meal digest in real-time.</string>

	<string name="FactFrog9">Purple Frogs spend 50 weeks a year underground. They only emerge for two weeks during the monsoon season to find a mate and lay eggs.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog10">The Borneo Flat-headed Frog has no lungs. It breathes entirely through its skin, which allows it to absorb more oxygen from the fast-flowing, cold water it calls home.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog11">Gastric-brooding frogs give birth through their mouths. The female swallows her fertilized eggs and shuts off her stomach acid while the babies develop inside her.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog12">Surinam Toads carry their young in their backs. The eggs are embedded into the mother’s skin, and eventually, fully formed toadlets erupt directly from her pores.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog13">Strawberry Poison Dart Frogs are dedicated commuters. The mother carries each individual tadpole on her back to a separate water-filled bromeliad leaf high in the canopy.</string>

	<string name="FactFrog17">Black Rain Frogs look like grumpy avocados. Their round, subterranean bodies and permanent scowls have made them a viral sensation for looking perpetually disappointed.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog18">Crucifix Toads produce their own «super glue». When harassed, they secrete a sticky protein that hardens in seconds, often gluing the mouth of a predator shut.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog19">The Wallace’s Flying Frog has «parachutes» for feet. Massive webbing between its toes allows it to glide from tree to tree to escape danger.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog20">Frogs can’t vomit in the traditional sense. If a frog eats something toxic, it may eject its entire stomach out of its mouth to «wash» it with its paws before swallowing it back down.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog21">Gladiator Frogs build their own private swimming pools. Males dig circular depressions in the mud near riverbanks to create protected nurseries for their eggs.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog22">The Map Frog has skin that looks like a topographical map. This intricate pattern allows it to blend perfectly into the leaf litter and mossy bark of the Amazon.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog23">Some frogs can change color like chameleons. Certain species, like the Pacific Tree Frog, can shift from green to brown in minutes to match their immediate surroundings.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog24">The Turtle Frog looks more like a raw hamburger than an amphibian. It has a round, fleshy body and tiny limbs designed for digging forward into termite mounds rather than hopping.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog25">Fanged Frogs have «bone spurs» in their lower jaws. While not true teeth, these sharp protrusions are used to battle other males and even take down large insects or small crabs.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog26">The Budgett’s Frog is known as the «Freddy Krueger» of frogs. It is highly aggressive and will actually scream and lung at anything it perceives as a threat.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog27">Waxy Monkey Frogs don’t dry out in the sun. They secrete a waxy lipid from their skin and use their legs to «lotion» their entire bodies to seal in moisture.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog28">Cane Toads are notoriously undiscriminating eaters. They will eat almost anything that fits in their mouths, including insects, small mammals, and even pet food left outside.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog29">The Tomato Frog inflates like a balloon when scared. If a predator tries to bite it, the frog also secretes a gummy white toxin that can glue the predator’s eyes and mouth shut.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog30">Some frogs eat their own shed skin. Since skin contains valuable proteins and nutrients, many species pull their old skin off with their mouths and swallow it whole.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog31">The South American Horned Frog is nicknamed the «Pac-Man» frog. Its mouth makes up nearly half of its body, allowing it to swallow prey almost as large as itself.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog32">A frog’s tongue is attached to the front of its mouth. This allows the tongue to flip forward at incredible speeds, acting like a sticky whip to snag flies.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog33">Frogs are actually «living fossils». Ancestors of modern frogs have been hopping around the Earth for over 250 million years, predating many dinosaurs.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog34">The Titicaca Water Frog is also called the «Scrotum Frog». It has excessive, baggy folds of skin that help it absorb oxygen in the thin air of high-altitude lakes.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog35">The Goliath Frog is the largest in the world. It can grow up to 12.5 inches long and weigh as much as a domestic cat.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog36">Some frogs use ultrasound to talk over waterfalls. The Hole-in-the-wall Frog emits frequencies so high that humans can’t hear them, but they pierce right through the roar of rushing water.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog37">Frogs have a «third eye» on top of their heads. Known as the parietal organ, it looks like a small dot and helps them detect light and navigate using the sun.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog38">The Coqui frog’s call is as loud as a lawnmower. In Hawaii, where they are invasive, their nighttime choruses reach decibels high enough to cause sleep deprivation in residents.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog39">Frogs can hear with their lungs. Some species use their lung tissue to pick up sound vibrations and pass them along to their inner ears.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog40">The Woodhouse’s Toad has a call that sounds like a sheep’s bleat. If you were walking through a forest at night, you might genuinely think you were surrounded by tiny, invisible farm animals.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog41">The Bird-poop Frog is a master of «disgusting» camouflage. It has a lumpy, white-and-brown body that makes it look exactly like a fresh bird dropping to avoid being eaten.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog42">Vietnamese Mossy Frogs are essentially invisible. Their skin is covered in green and black bumps that perfectly mimic the texture of damp forest moss.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog43">The Pebbles Toad turns into a ball to escape. Instead of hopping away from predators on cliffs, it tucks its limbs in and bounces down the rocks like a piece of rubber.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog44">Malayan Leaf Frogs have literal «horns» above their eyes. These skin flaps mimic the tips of dead leaves, helping them disappear into the forest floor.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog45">The Shovel-headed Tree Frog uses its head as a door. It retreats into holes in trees and uses its flat, bony skull to plug the entrance, keeping predators out.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog46">Phyllomedusa frogs produce «Kambo» secretions. Some indigenous tribes use this toxic skin mucus in traditional rituals to induce «cleansing» through intense physical reactions.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog47">The Mink Frog smells like a rotten onion. When handled or stressed, it releases a pungent odor that mimics the scent of decaying vegetables to ward off handlers.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog48">Frogs are the source of a powerful new painkiller. Scientists discovered a compound in the skin of the Epipedobates tricolor that is 200 times more potent than morphine.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog49">Bicolor Leaf Frogs use «sunscreen». They produce a secretion that reflects UV rays, allowing them to bask in the tropical sun without damaging their sensitive skin.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog50">The Fire-bellied Toad uses its belly as a warning sign. When threatened, it arches its back to show off its bright orange underside, signaling to predators that it is toxic.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog51">The Paedophryne amauensis is the smallest vertebrate in the world. This tiny frog from Papua New Guinea is only about 7.7 millimeters long, fitting easily on a fingernail.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog52">Some frogs can survive in the desert for years. The Water-holding Frog creates a waterproof cocoon of shed skin and stays dormant underground until it rains.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog53">Spring Peeper frogs are «seasonal psychics». Their high-pitched chirping is one of the first reliable signs of spring in North America, even if there is still snow on the ground.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog54">The Monkey Frog doesn’t hop, it walks. Its limbs move one at a time in a slow, deliberate crawling motion similar to a primate moving through branches.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog55">Greenhouse Frogs don’t need ponds. They lay their eggs on land, and the babies skip the tadpole stage entirely, hatching as fully formed, microscopic frogs.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog56">The Barking Tree Frog sounds like a lonely hound. Its call is a repetitive, hollow «donk» that, from a distance, is easily mistaken for a dog barking in the woods.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog57">Mountain Chicken Frogs are actually giant frogs. Despite the name, they are one of the world’s largest frogs and were once a popular food source in the Caribbean.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog58">The Squirrel Tree Frog is a «rain forecaster». They are known to call loudly just before or during summer rainstorms, earning them the nickname «Rain Frog» in the Southern US.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog59">Carpenter Frogs sound like a construction site. Their call mimics the sound of two hammers hitting a nail in rapid succession.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog60">Some frogs have «ears» on their backs. The Gardiner’s Seychelles Frog lacks middle ears and eardrums, using its mouth cavity to resonate and «hear» sound.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog61">Black-eyed Leaf Frogs have vibrant magenta flanks. While they look plain green from above, they flash these bright colors when they leap to startle predators.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog62">The Pumpkin Toadlet has bones that glow in the dark. Their skeletons are fluorescent and shine through their skin when exposed to UV light, likely as a warning to others.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog63">Some frogs have «extra» ribs. The Ribbed Newt (often grouped in amphibian studies) can push its ribs through its skin to act as venom-tipped spikes.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog64">The European Common Frog can breathe through its butt. While mostly using lungs and skin, it can perform cloacal respiration to stay submerged in cold water for long periods.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog65">The Ghost Frog lives in the «spray zones» of waterfalls. They have developed massive, suction-cup-like toe pads to keep from being washed away by torrential currents.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog66">The Crab-eating Frog can survive in saltwater. It is one of the few amphibians capable of living in mangrove swamps by adjusting the urea levels in its blood.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog67">Spadefoot Toads use «shovels» on their feet. They have hard, keratinized protrusions on their hind legs that allow them to dig backward into the dirt with incredible speed.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog68">The Holy Cross Frog secretes a natural insect repellent. Its sticky skin glue not only traps attackers but also prevents biting flies from landing on it.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog69">Gray Tree Frogs are «antifreeze» experts. They produce high concentrations of glycerol in their blood to prevent their cells from bursting when temperatures drop below freezing.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog70">The American Toad can live for over 30 years. While most wild frogs have short lives, those in protected environments show surprising longevity for such small creatures.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog71">The African Foam-nest Tree Frog creates «bubble baths» for eggs. Groups of frogs whip up a frothy foam nest on branches overhanging water to keep eggs moist.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog72">Fowler’s Toads can lay up to 25,000 eggs at once. This «quantity over quality» strategy ensures that at least a few survive the gauntlet of predators.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog73">The Midwife Toad male carries the eggs. After the female lays them, the male wraps the egg strings around his back legs and carries them everywhere until they hatch.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog74">Some tadpoles are carnivorous. In crowded ponds, certain spadefoot toad tadpoles develop larger heads and sharper beaks to eat their own siblings.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog75">The Long-nosed Horned Frog is a «sit and wait» master. It remains perfectly still for days, looking like a dead leaf, until a lizard or large insect walks directly into its mouth.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog76">The «Devil Frog» (Beelzebufo) once ate baby dinosaurs. This extinct giant from Madagascar was the size of a beach ball and had a bite force comparable to a tiger.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog77">Clawed Frogs were once used as human pregnancy tests. In the 1940s, doctors discovered that injecting a woman’s urine into a female frog would cause the frog to lay eggs if the woman was pregnant.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog78">The Harlequin Toad is actually a member of the toad family but looks like a frog. These «toads» are brightly colored and move like athletes, breaking the stereotype of the slow, warty toad.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog79">Frogs have been to space. In 1970, NASA sent two bullfrogs into orbit on the «Orbiting Frog Otolith» satellite to study how weightlessness affected their balance.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog80">The Wood Frog’s heart actually stops beating during winter. When it freezes, its heart and breathing cease entirely, only to restart within an hour of thawing out.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog81">Some frogs can see color in total darkness. Most animals lose color vision in low light, but certain frogs have unique rod cells that allow them to see a full spectrum even in the dead of night.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog82">Frogs are the world’s first true «vocalists». While insects made sounds first, frogs were the first land animals to evolve vocal cords to produce a complex, controlled voice.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog83">A frog’s «ears» can be larger than its eyes. The tympanum (eardrum) on the side of a frog’s head varies in size, in many species, a larger eardrum indicates a male with a louder, deeper call.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog84">The Pine Barrens Tree Frog is a «pH snob». It specifically chooses to live in acidic cedar swamps that would be chemically «burning» and toxic to almost any other frog species.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog85">Frogs have a «drink patch» on their bellies. They don’t swallow water with their mouths, instead, they press a thin, highly permeable area of skin on their lower abdomen against wet surfaces to «wick» moisture into their bodies.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog86">Male «True Toads» possess a «ghost» ovary. Known as the Bidder’s organ, this underdeveloped female reproductive organ remains in males and can actually become functional if their primary hormones shift.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog87">The Common Reed Frog can change its sex. If a colony has too few males to fertilize eggs, some females can transition into functional males to ensure the population survives.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog88">Some frogs use «toe tapping» to hunt. They twitch their long middle toes rhythmically on the ground to mimic the vibrations of a struggling insect, «luring» real bugs closer to investigate.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog89">Frogs were the first to «invent» dental decay. While most skip the dentist, researchers found that some fossilized ancient frogs are among the earliest vertebrates to show evidence of tooth cavities.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog90">The secretion of the Monkey Frog is used as «Amphibian Bio-glue». Scientists are studying its skin peptides to create surgical glues that can seal wounds inside the human body without causing irritation.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog91">Frogs can predict earthquakes. In 2009, a colony of common toads in Italy famously abandoned their breeding pond five days before a major earthquake struck, likely sensing pre-seismic shifts in groundwater.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog92">The High Himalaya Frog lives at 16,000 feet. It thrives at altitudes where the oxygen is so thin and the temperatures so low that most other cold-blooded animals would perish instantly.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog93">Frogs have been used as «Milk Preservers». Before refrigeration, some European cultures placed live Russian Brown frogs in milk pails because the antimicrobial peptides on their skin prevented the milk from spoiling.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog94">The world’s longest frog jump was over 33 feet. A South African sharp-nosed frog named «Santjie» holds the record, covering a distance in three hops that would take a human Olympic jumper to match.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog95">Frogs are «Living Rain Gauges». Their skin is so sensitive to barometric pressure and humidity that many species will begin a «rain call» hours before a single drop of water actually falls.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog96">The «Mini» genus has some of the best names in science. There are three species of tiny frogs officially named Mini mum, Mini scule, and Mini ature.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog97">Tadpoles can «panic-age» to survive. If a tadpole senses its pond is drying up or sees too many predators, it can release hormones to accelerate its metamorphosis and hop out days earlier than normal.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog98">The «Spring Peeper» has a built-in «X» on its back. This tiny frog is easily identified by the dark cross-shaped mark on its skin, which is why its scientific name is Pseudacris crucifer.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog99">Frogs are «Environmental Canaries». Because they breathe through their skin, they are the first to get sick when water is polluted, serving as an early warning system for the health of an entire ecosystem.</string>
	<string name="FactFrog100">The «Paradoxical Frog» is the ultimate Benjamin Button. Its tadpole is a massive 10 inches long, but as it undergoes metamorphosis, it actually loses most of its mass and turns into a 2-inch adult frog.</string>
	<string name="FactBober1">Beavers have orange teeth because their enamel contains high amounts of iron. This mineral makes their teeth incredibly strong and resistant to acid.</string>
	<string name="FactBober2">Their front teeth never stop growing throughout their entire lives. They must constantly gnaw on wood to prevent their incisors from becoming too long.</string>
	<string name="FactBober3">A beaver’s tail serves as a multi-purpose tool for swimming and balance. It also acts as a fat storage unit to help them survive the winter.</string>
	<string name="FactBober4">They possess a second set of transparent eyelids called nictitating membranes. These act like built-in goggles so they can see clearly underwater.</string>
	<string name="FactBober5">Beavers have specialized «comb claws» on their hind feet. These split toenails are used specifically for grooming and spreading oils through their fur.</string>
	<string name="FactBober6">Their ears and nostrils automatically clamp shut when they submerge. This creates a watertight seal that keeps them comfortable while working.</string>
	<string name="FactBober7">A beaver’s lips can close behind its front teeth. This allows them to chew on branches underwater without drowning or swallowing pond water.</string>
	<string name="FactBober8">They have a massive cecum that contains specialized bacteria for digesting wood. This allows them to extract energy from cellulose that other mammals can’t process.</string>
	<string name="FactBober9">Their hind feet are fully webbed like a duck’s. This design provides massive propulsion, allowing them to swim up to 5 miles per hour.</string>
	<string name="FactBober10">A beaver can hold its breath for up to 15 minutes. Their heart rate slows down significantly during dives to conserve oxygen.</string>
	<string name="FactBober11">Beavers produce a chemical compound called castoreum from scent glands near their tail. This substance has a distinct, pleasant smell reminiscent of vanilla.</string>
	<string name="FactBober12">For decades, castoreum was used as a food additive in perfumes and artificial flavorings. While it is rare today, it is still FDA-approved for human consumption.</string>
	<string name="FactBober13">They use this «vanilla goo» to mark their territory. By piling up mud and secreting the oil, they tell other beavers that the pond is occupied.</string>
	<string name="FactBober14">Ancient Greeks believed castoreum could cure headaches and epilepsy. They would often hunt beavers specifically to harvest this pungent secretion.</string>
	<string name="FactBober15">The word «castor» in their scientific name Castor canadensis comes from the Greek word for the animal. It highlights the historical importance of their scent glands.</string>
	<string name="FactBober16">Beaver dams are the only animal-made structures visible from space. A single dam in Alberta, Canada, stretches over 2,700 feet long.</string>
	<string name="FactBober17">They don’t just build for fun, they build to create deep-water moats. This protects them from predators like wolves and bears who dislike deep water.</string>
	<string name="FactBober18">Beavers are «ecosystem engineers» because they fundamentally change the landscape. Their dams create wetlands that support thousands of other species.</string>
	<string name="FactBober19">They build their lodges with underwater entrances to keep land predators out. Inside, they have dry platforms for sleeping and raising their young.</string>
	<string name="FactBober20">A single beaver can chew through a 6-inch tree in less than 15 minutes. They use their powerful neck muscles to drive their iron-fortified teeth through the wood.</string>
	<string name="FactBober21">They prefer to work at night to avoid being spotted by predators. Most of their massive construction projects happen under the cover of darkness.</string>
	<string name="FactBober22">Beavers use mud as «caulk» to seal their dams and lodges. This mud freezes in the winter, making the structure as hard as stone against predators.</string>
	<string name="FactBober23">They often dig «canals» to float heavy logs from the forest to their pond. This is much easier than dragging the wood across dry land.</string>
	<string name="FactBober24">If a beaver hears the sound of running water, it feels an instinctive urge to build. Scientists once played a recording of a stream next to a beaver, and it immediately tried to cover the speaker with mud.</string>
	<string name="FactBober25">Their dams help filter toxins and sediment out of the water. This improves the overall water quality for everyone downstream.</string>
	<string name="FactBober26">Beavers are generally monogamous and stay with their partners for life. They form tight-knit family units known as colonies.</string>
	<string name="FactBober27">A typical colony consists of the parents, the new kits, and the yearlings from the previous spring. The older siblings actually help «babysit» the younger ones.</string>
	<string name="FactBober28">Young beavers are called «kits» or «pups». They are born fully furred and can usually swim within 24 hours of birth.</string>
	<string name="FactBober29">Kits make a sound that remarkably resembles a human baby crying. This high-pitched «mewing» is used to get their mother’s attention.</string>
	<string name="FactBober30">When a kit is two years old, it is «kicked out» of the lodge. It must then travel miles away to find a mate and start its own colony.</string>
	<string name="FactBober31">Beavers are very vocal and communicate through whimpers, groans, and bellows. They also use body language, like tail slapping, to signal danger.</string>
	<string name="FactBober32">They spend a significant portion of their day grooming each other. This social bonding helps keep their fur waterproof and free of parasites.</string>
	<string name="FactBober33">A beaver family can eat through an entire acre of trees in a single year. They are surprisingly efficient at harvesting their «timber crops».</string>
	<string name="FactBober34">They share their lodges with other animals sometimes. Muskrats have been known to live in the «spare rooms» of beaver lodges in exchange for helping with repairs.</string>
	<string name="FactBober35">The mother beaver is the primary leader of the lodge. She usually decides where the family will move if the food supply runs low.</string>
	<string name="FactBober36">Beavers are strictly herbivores and do not eat fish. Many people mistakenly believe they eat trout, but they actually prefer willow, aspen, and aquatic plants.</string>
	<string name="FactBober37">They slap their flat tails against the water’s surface to warn others of danger. The sound is as loud as a gunshot and can be heard for long distances.</string>
	<string name="FactBober38">During the winter, they store a «food cache» of branches at the bottom of the pond. The cold water keeps the wood fresh, acting like a giant refrigerator.</string>

	<string name="FactAlien1">The Fermi Paradox highlights the contradiction between the high probability of alien life and our lack of contact. It asks the simple, haunting question: «Where is everybody?»</string>
	<string name="FactAlien2">Some scientists suggest the «Zoo Hypothesis» as an answer to this paradox. It proposes that advanced aliens are aware of us but choose to watch from a distance without interfering.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien3">The «Great Filter» theory suggests there is a developmental wall that most civilizations hit before they can travel through space. This could mean we are either incredibly lucky to have passed it or doomed to face it soon.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien4">Frank Drake created the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of active civilizations in our galaxy. While mathematically sound, many of its variables remain complete guesswork.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien5">The «Wow! Signal» was a strong narrowband radio signal detected in 1977 that lasted 72 seconds. It has never been heard again, leaving its origin one of the greatest mysteries in SETI history.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien6">The Rare Earth Hypothesis argues that the conditions required for complex life are so specific they might only exist here. This suggests that while microbial life might be common, «intelligent» life is a cosmic fluke.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien7">Some researchers believe in «Shadow Biospheres» right here on Earth. These would be life forms with a completely different biochemistry that we simply haven’t learned how to see yet.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien8">The «Dark Forest» theory posits that the universe is a dangerous place where civilizations stay silent to avoid being destroyed. Under this view, any civilization that broadcasts its location is a target.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien9">NASA’s Viking landers in 1976 actually tested Martian soil for life and got a positive result. However, the scientific community later dismissed it as a non-biological chemical reaction.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien10">The Panspermia theory suggests that life on Earth may have been «seeded» by microbes hitching a ride on asteroids. If true, we might actually be the descendants of Martians or other aliens.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien11">Tardigrades, or «water bears», can survive the vacuum and intense radiation of open space. Their resilience proves that Earth-based life could potentially survive a journey between planets.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien12">The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans can survive radiation doses thousands of times higher than what would kill a human. It is often nicknamed «Conan the Bacterium» for its incredible toughness.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien13">On Saturn’s moon Enceladus, giant geysers blast saltwater and organic molecules into space. This suggests a warm, subsurface ocean that might be the best place to look for life today.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien14">Jupiter’s moon Europa contains more liquid water than all of Earth’s oceans combined. This water is hidden beneath a global shell of ice that may be miles thick.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien15">Titan, a moon of Saturn, has lakes and rivers made of liquid methane and ethane instead of water. Life there would need a completely different «methanogenic» biochemistry to survive.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien16">Some scientists believe Venus could host microbial life in its upper atmosphere. While the surface is a 460°C hellscape, the clouds 50 kilometers up have Earth-like temperatures and pressures.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien17">Deep-sea hydrothermal vents on Earth host life that survives without any sunlight at all. These ecosystems serve as a primary model for how life might exist on icy moons like Europa.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien18">Microbes have been found living inside solid rocks deep within the Earth’s crust. This «deep biosphere» suggests life could exist deep underground on Mars where it is protected from radiation.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien19">There is a «habitable zone» not just around stars, but around entire galaxies. Too close to the center and radiation is too high, too far out and there aren’t enough heavy elements to build planets.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien20">Red Dwarf stars are the most common in the universe and can live for trillions of years. This gives life on their planets a massive amount of time to evolve, though these stars are prone to violent flares.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien21">The exoplanet HD 189733b looks like a beautiful blue marble, but it rains molten glass sideways. Winds on this planet reach speeds of 8,700 kilometers per hour.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien22">55 Cancri e is a «Super-Earth» that is believed to be made largely of diamond. The planet is so hot and under such pressure that its carbon-rich interior has likely crystallized.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien23">TrES-2b is the darkest planet ever discovered, reflecting less than 1% of the light that hits it. It is literally blacker than coal and glows with a faint, hellish red heat.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien24">The planet K2-18b was found to have water vapor in its atmosphere and sits in its star’s habitable zone. It is one of the top candidates for a «Hycean» world—a planet covered entirely by a massive ocean.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien25">WASP-12b is a «pitch black» planet that is currently being eaten by its host star. It is being stretched into an egg shape by the star’s gravity and will be consumed in about 10 million years.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien26">On the planet WASP-76b, it is so hot that iron vaporizes during the day and falls as «iron rain» at night. The temperature difference between its two sides is over 1,000°C.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien27">Kepler-16b is a real-life «Tatooine» that orbits two stars at once. If you stood on its surface, you would have two distinct shadows and see two sunsets every day.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien28">Gliese 581c was once thought to be a prime candidate for life, but it is tidally locked. One side is a frozen wasteland while the other is a scorched desert, leaving only a thin «twilight» strip potentially habitable.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien29">J1407b is an exoplanet with a ring system 200 times larger than Saturn’s. If it replaced Saturn in our solar system, its rings would be clearly visible and larger than the full moon.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien30">The «Methuselah» planet, PSR B1620-26 b, is nearly 13 billion years old. It formed only a billion years after the Big Bang, suggesting planets (and life) could have started very early.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien31">In 1974, we broadcast the Arecibo Message toward a star cluster 25,000 light-years away. It contained binary code describing human DNA, our appearance, and our solar system.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien32">The Voyager Golden Records contain sounds of Earth, music, and greetings in 55 languages. They are currently the most distant man-made objects, acting as a «message in a bottle» to the cosmos.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien33">Technosignatures are signs of advanced technology, like atmospheric pollution or massive solar arrays. Some astronomers look for «CFCs» in alien atmospheres as proof of industrial civilizations.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien34">A Dyson Sphere is a theoretical megastructure built around a star to capture all of its energy. If we saw a star’s light dipping in a strange, non-periodic way, it might be evidence of such a structure.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien35">Tabby’s Star (KIC 8462852) gained fame for its erratic dimming that defied standard explanations. While most now think it’s dust, some still speculate it could be an alien construction project.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien36">We have sent «Active SETI» messages to nearby stars, but many scientists think this is dangerous. Stephen Hawking famously warned that we should be careful about shouting into the cosmic woods.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien37">Laser SETI looks for brief pulses of light rather than radio waves. Advanced aliens might use lasers for communication because they can carry much more data over long distances.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien38">Some theorists suggest that Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) could be the exhaust from alien spacecraft. These millisecond-long bursts of energy come from galaxies billions of light-years away.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien39">The «Oort Cloud» at the edge of our solar system could contain trillions of icy bodies. Some speculate that alien probes could be hiding there, waiting for us to become «interesting» enough.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien40">If an alien civilization 65 million light-years away looked at Earth through a powerful telescope, they would see dinosaurs. Light takes time to travel, making the universe a giant time machine.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien41">Life on Earth uses Left-Handed Amino Acids, a phenomenon called homochirality. If we find life that uses right-handed ones, it would prove a completely independent origin of life.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien42">Arsenic-based life was once thought to have been found in a California lake. While the study was later debunked, it opened the door to the idea of life using «toxic» elements.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien43">Silicon-based life is a popular sci-fi trope because silicon is chemically similar to carbon. However, silicon is much «stickier» and harder to breathe out as a gas, making it less likely than carbon.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien44">Bioluminescence might be a common trait for life on planets with low light or deep oceans. Entire alien ecosystems could glow in the dark to communicate or hunt.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien45">High-gravity planets might produce «flat» life forms that hug the ground to avoid being crushed. These creatures would likely be incredibly muscular and slow-moving.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien46">Planets orbiting M-dwarf stars (red dwarfs) are often bathed in infrared light. Plants there might appear black to our eyes to absorb as much energy as possible.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien47">The discovery of Phosphine in the clouds of Venus sparked a massive debate in 2020. On Earth, this gas is mostly produced by anaerobic microbes, making it a «potential» biosignature.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien48">Scientists have found amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—on meteorites like the Murchison meteorite. This proves that the ingredients for life are literally floating around in space.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien49">«Oumuamua», the first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system, had a very strange shape and acceleration. While most think it’s a comet, Harvard’s Avi Loeb famously argued it could be a light sail.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien50">If life exists on a rogue planet (a planet with no star), it would have to survive on internal geothermal heat. Such life would live in permanent darkness, likely deep under a thick crust of ice.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien51">On HAT-P-7b, the clouds are likely made of corundum—the mineral that forms rubies and sapphires. This means the planet literally has «precious gem» weather.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien52">Kepler-10b is a «lava world» where the surface is so hot it stays molten. One side of the planet is a permanent ocean of liquid rock.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien53">Some planets are «Eyeball Planets», where tidal locking creates a giant circle of liquid water facing the star. From space, these planets look like a giant eye staring into the void.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien54">Gliese 436b is a planet made of «burning ice». The gravity is so strong it keeps water in a solid state (Ice VII) even though the temperature is over 400°C.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien55">PSR J1719-1438 b is a planet that orbits a pulsar and is almost entirely made of diamond. It is essentially the compressed remains of a former star’s core.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien56">The planet HD 209458b (Osiris) is evaporating so fast it has a tail like a comet. It is losing about 10,000 tons of hydrogen every single second.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien57">TOI-849b appears to be the exposed core of a gas giant whose atmosphere was stripped away. It is a rocky world 40 times the mass of Earth, which shouldn’t technically be possible.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien58">Some planets orbit three stars at once, like the system GW Orionis. The gravitational dance in these systems is so complex it can tear planetary disks apart.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien59">Kepler-444 is a star system that is 11 billion years old and has five Earth-sized planets. This proves that rocky planets have been forming since the universe was in its infancy.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien60">The «Pink Planet» GJ 504b glows with a magenta hue because it is still young and hot. It is roughly the size of Jupiter but four times more massive.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien61">The first human «message» to potentially reach aliens was actually a 1936 TV broadcast of the Berlin Olympics. It wasn’t intended for space, but the signal was strong enough to leak out.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien62">NASA has a Planetary Protection Officer whose job is to prevent Earth microbes from «infecting» other planets. They also ensure we don’t accidentally bring alien «bugs» back to Earth.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien63">If we ever find a signal, the SETI post-detection protocols say we shouldn’t reply without international consultation. Of course, there is no way to actually enforce this «rule».</string>
	<string name="FactAlien64">Some philosophers argue that finding aliens would be the most humbling event in human history. It would officially end the idea that we are the center of the universe.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien65">The «Lincos» language was created by Hans Freudenthal as a way to communicate with aliens using logic and math. It is designed to be understood by any civilization with a basic grasp of numbers.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien66">In 2008, the song «Across the Universe» by the Beatles was beamed toward the North Star, Polaris. It will take 431 years for the «message» to arrive.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien67">Some scientists think we should look for «Alien Trash» rather than signals. Dyson spheres, spent nuclear fuel, or defunct probes might be easier to spot than a deliberate greeting.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien68">The METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) organization actively sends signals to the stars. This is controversial because it «advertises» our presence to unknown entities.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien69">Frank Drake once sent a «picture» of a human to a colleague to see if he could decode it. The colleague failed, highlighting how hard it will be to understand an alien message.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien70">Astronomer Jill Tarter has spent over 35 years searching for signals. She was the primary inspiration for Jodie Foster’s character in the movie Contact.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien71">If a planet has a very thick atmosphere, life might evolve to float like biological hot-air balloons. These «air-whales» could spend their entire lives without ever touching a surface.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien72">Life on a high-gravity world would likely have many legs or a very wide base. Think of creatures built like tanks or low-slung crabs.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien73">On planets orbiting binary stars, life would have to adapt to wildly changing light cycles. Some «days» might have two suns, while others might have only one or none.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien74">Some speculate that «intelligent» life might eventually move beyond biology into digital forms. A civilization millions of years older than us might just be a giant supercomputer.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien75">If aliens evolved in the subsurface oceans of moons, they might not even know stars exist. They would live in a world of ice and water, unaware of the vast universe above.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien76">Convergent evolution suggests that similar environments produce similar features. This means aliens might have eyes, limbs, or brains remarkably like ours if their planet is Earth-like.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien77">Aliens might not use sound to communicate if their atmosphere is too thin. They might use light-flashes, scent-trails, or even direct electrical signals.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien78">Large-brained animals on Earth, like octopuses and crows, show that intelligence can evolve in very different body types. Alien «geniuses» don’t necessarily need to look like humans.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien79">If a planet is cloud-covered 24/7, the inhabitants might never develop astronomy. Their technology and culture would be fundamentally limited by their lack of «the big picture».</string>
	<string name="FactAlien80">Some scientists think the «standard» alien might be small, microbial, and incredibly boring. We hope for «Little Green Men», but we’ll likely find «Little Green Slime».</string>
	<string name="FactAlien81">«Polyextremophiles» are organisms that can survive multiple harsh conditions at once. They are the ultimate «survivors» and the best candidates for interstellar travel.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien82">The «Water Hole» is a specific frequency range in the radio spectrum between hydrogen and hydroxyl. Because it’s quiet and related to water, scientists think it’s a natural place for aliens to broadcast.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien83">The «Medusa Hypothesis» suggests that life itself occasionally creates conditions that lead to its own mass extinction. This could be why we don’t see many long-lived civilizations.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien84">NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope discovered that there are more planets than stars in our galaxy. Statistically, every star you see in the night sky likely has at least one planet.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien85">The James Webb Space Telescope can «sniff» the atmospheres of exoplanets by watching how starlight passes through them. It is our best tool yet for finding «bio-signatures» on distant worlds.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien86">«Super-Earths» (planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune) are the most common type of planet in the galaxy. Ironically, we don’t have a single one in our own solar system.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien87">Some believe that «Von Neumann Probes» — self-replicating robots — could map the entire galaxy in a few million years. If they existed, we should have seen them by now.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien88">The «Great Silence» refers to the fact that we have been listening for 60 years and haven’t heard a single confirmed word. Space is either very empty or we are very bad at listening.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien89">Chirality (the «handedness» of molecules) might be determined by the spin of cosmic rays. This could mean that life everywhere in a galaxy shares the same molecular «orientation».</string>
	<string name="FactAlien90">The «Habitable Edge» of an icy moon is the thin interface where the ice meets the ocean. This is where nutrients and energy are most likely to mix and spark life.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien91">If we found life on Mars, we would have to prove it wasn’t just «Earth life» we accidentally sent there. We’ve been crashing probes into Mars for decades, and some microbes may have survived.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien92">«Biological dark matter» refers to the 99% of microbes on Earth that cannot be grown in a lab. If we can’t understand the life here, understanding life on another planet will be incredibly difficult.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien93">The «Gaia Hypothesis» suggests that life and its environment form a single self-regulating system. An «alien» might not be a single creature, but an entire planetary organism.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien94">Some researchers look for «Megastructures» around White Dwarfs. Since these stars are dead, any large structure there would almost certainly be artificial.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien95">«Extraterrestrial» doesn’t always mean «from another planet». Life could theoretically exist in the atmosphere of a star or even in the vacuum of a nebula.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien96">The «Copernican Principle» states that Earth is not special. If we are typical, then the universe should be absolutely teeming with life just like us.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien97">«Tidal Heating» can keep a moon warm even if it’s far from the sun. The constant squeezing from a giant planet’s gravity creates friction and heat in the moon’s core.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien98">«Zombie Planets» are those that orbit pulsars (dead, spinning stars). These planets are bathed in lethal radiation, making life there almost impossible—but not quite.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien99">Symmetry (having a left and right side) is common on Earth because it helps with movement. Alien life might use radial symmetry (like a starfish) or no symmetry at all.</string>
	<string name="FactAlien100">Despite all the math and telescopes, the only «weird fact» we know for sure is that we exist. That alone is enough to prove that the universe is capable of producing life.</string>
