	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog0">Look, I have found this strange book on ritual site. Take it.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7AnswerOption0">Thanks, do you know who can help me with it?</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog1">Try to ask catus they usually more experienced in wisdom stuff, the older the better.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog2">One more thing, at the same ritual site I have found the body of the lost pet. Poor guy. Do not worry I will return him back to his grave.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8AnswerOption0">[Show the book] Do you know anything about this book?</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8Dialog0">What is this? I can sense some magic but I am not sure…</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8Dialog1">Ahh, yes, I know what it is. This is Necronomicon. Very dangerous stuff, I recommend to destroy it right away, nothing good will come from it. However I can also teach you how to use it. Your choice. So do you want to use it or destroy it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer0">Hey buddy, I have noticed you barely touch your food, what is going on?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Dialog0">Yeah, you know what, I think I want some fish, could you catch me some? There is a lake nearby I think you can try there.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer1">All right, let us see what I can do. I think I will come up with something on next day.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer0">Oi mate, here is fish you have asked for. From very same lake you described.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Dialog0">Cheers mate, that is what I am talking about! Real fresh fish, el belissimo! Now I know this lake is good, think I will spend some time there by myself. Thanks again!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer1">No problem!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer0">Hey, what is that you are playing with?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Dialog0">Ah, found it on the lake. Round and rolling! Also smells like slime but it is okay. Here, take it, I am done playing with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer1">Thank you, I think I know what to do with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer0">Hey, do you know where all the eggs went?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog0">Wow! I do not know anything about this, but I can look for it, ask me tomorrow, maybe I will find something.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog1">I do not know anything and, honestly, I do not care.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer1">Thank you, I will come see you tomorrow!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Answer0">Well, did you find anything?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Dialog0">Nope, still looking.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage4Dialog0">Aha, I found all the eggs, well, you made me run! I suspect that they just rolled away or maybe the wind blew them away, I put them back in place, now they definitely will not roll away.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Answer0">The eggs are missing again, do you know anything about it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog0">What, again? Oh my! Okay, I will look again, but after I find it, you better come up with something so that this does not happen again.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog1">Ahahahahahahahaha! Seriously? Well, screw them.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Dialog0">Here they are, finally. Listen, I do not want to run around looking for the missing eggs again if something else happens to them. Ask someone else, maybe they can help, we need to solve this problem somehow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Answer0">Okay, I will ask around.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Answer0">Maybe you know what to do with these constantly rolling eggs?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog0">Hmm, I do not know how to help you with this, but I think I know someone who knows what to do. My friends from the pond, handy guys. I will ask them, come see me tomorrow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog1">I told you to ask someone else, do we all look the same to you?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog2">Well, do I look like someone who can control the wind?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Answer0">Well, have you heard from your friends?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Dialog0">They said they would do everything in the best possible way, wait a little longer.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Dialog0">Yes! Look what they just sent us - a beautiful, reliable basket for storing eggs (with a lid). And along with the basket they sent a Bober egg - lucky!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Answer0">Truly a stroke of luck! I will have to try and hatch one or two.</string>

	<!-- Quest description -->
	<string name="QuestIsFinished">Done</string>
	<string name="QuestNameNecronomicon">Lost and found</string>
	<string name="QuestNameObtainFrogus">Fish and consequences</string>
	<string name="QuestNameObtainBober">Must be a wind</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage0">Something tells me that I need to make sure I understand catus properly.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage1">Great, now I need to ask catus, maybe someone needs some help.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage2">As I thought, one of the katus asked me to diversify the menu and find some fish somewhere. I will look for it near the pond he was talking about.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage3">Well, I caught some fish, I should give it to the catus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage4">Catus was pleased with my offering and said that he would go to the pond himself and evaluate its potential.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage5">I should probably ask Catus about his assessment of the pond.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage6">Well, the pond assessment turned out to be very successful, he even found a Frogus egg, which I am incredibly happy about.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand my pets.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage1">Here comes another beautiful day.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage2">Nothing foreshadows trouble.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage3">Oh no! Someone dug up the grave without the consent of the deceased’s closest relatives! I need to ask around, maybe someone knows something.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage4">Dogus asked me to bring something from the grave so that he could begin his search.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage5">I found a piece of fabric, I need to show it to the dogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage6">Dogus said that he would try to follow the trail.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage7">I should ask the dogus if he found anything.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage8">I learned that catus are knowledgeable in magic. And the longer they live, the better they understand it. Perhaps one of them can help me with this mysterious book.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage9Use">The old catus told me that the book that dogus found was the Necronomicon. He also warned me that it was a very dangerous book. However, I decided to ignore him and wanted to learn the knowledge that this book contains. It seems that now I can resurrect the dead.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage9Destroy">The old katus told me that the book that the dogus found was the Necronomicon. He also warned me that it was a very dangerous book. Taking his advice, I decided to destroy the book. To be on the safe side.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand my pets.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage1">The eggs are gone! The eggs are gone! What should I do?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage2">I will ask the pets, maybe they know something.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage3">Dogus agreed to look for the eggs and said to give him a day to do it.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage4">It seems it’s time to ask the dogus about the results of his search.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage5">Dogus successfully returned the eggs to their place, now nothing will happen to them.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage6">The eggs are gone again! What the hell is going on! Maybe someone else can help me?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage7">Dogus agreed to help me again and told me to think about solving the problem in the future.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage8">Perhaps it’s time to ask the dogus about the search results again.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage9">Dogus put all the eggs back in place. I really should ask the other pets to help me with this.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage10">Frogus said that he would ask his friends from the pond, he said that they are handy and know their business.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage11">It’s time to ask frogus if there is any news from his friends.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage12">Wow! These Bober guys not only gave me a basket for eggs, but they also entrusted me with one of their eggs so that I could care for future generations of bobers.</string>
