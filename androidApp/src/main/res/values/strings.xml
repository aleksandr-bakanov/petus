	<string name="NecronomiconStage8Dialog1">Ahh, yes, I know what it is. This is Necronomicon. Very dangerous stuff, I recommend to destroy it right away, nothing good will come from it. However I can also teach you how to use it. Your choice. So do you want to use it or destroy it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer0">Hey buddy, I have noticed you barely touch your food, what is going on?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Dialog0">Yeah, you know what, I think I want some fish, could you catch me some? There is a lake nearby I think you can try there.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer1">All right, let us see what I can do. I think I will come up with something on next day.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer0">Oi mate, here is fish you have asked for. From very same lake you described.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Dialog0">Cheers mate, that is what I am talking about! Real fresh fish, el belissimo! Now I know this lake is good, think I will spend some time there by myself. Thanks again!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer1">No problem!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer0">Hey, what is that you are playing with?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Dialog0">Ah, found it on the lake. Round and rolling! Also smells like slime but it is okay. Here, take it, I am done playing with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer1">Thank you, I think I know what to do with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer0">Hey, do you know where all the eggs went?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog0">Wow! I do not know anything about this, but I can look for it, ask me tomorrow, maybe I will find something.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog1">I do not know anything and, honestly, I do not care.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer1">Thank you, I will come see you tomorrow!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Answer0">Well, did you find anything?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Dialog0">Nope, still looking.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage4Dialog0">Aha, I found all the eggs, well, you made me run! I suspect that they just rolled away or maybe the wind blew them away, I put them back in place, now they definitely will not roll away.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Answer0">The eggs are missing again, do you know anything about it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog0">What, again? Oh my! Okay, I will look again, but after I find it, you better come up with something so that this does not happen again.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog1">Ahahahahahahahaha! Seriously? Well, screw them.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Dialog0">Here they are, finally. Listen, I do not want to run around looking for the missing eggs again if something else happens to them. Ask someone else, maybe they can help, we need to solve this problem somehow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Answer0">Okay, I will ask around.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Answer0">Maybe you know what to do with these constantly rolling eggs?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog0">Hmm, I do not know how to help you with this, but I think I know someone who knows what to do. My friends from the pond, handy guys. I will ask them, come see me tomorrow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog1">I told you to ask someone else, do we all look the same to you?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog2">Well, do I look like someone who can control the wind?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Answer0">Well, have you heard from your friends?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Dialog0">They said they would do everything in the best possible way, wait a little longer.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Dialog0">Yes! Look what they just sent us - a beautiful, reliable basket for storing eggs (with a lid). And along with the basket they sent a Bober egg - lucky!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Answer0">Truly a stroke of luck! I will have to try and hatch one or two.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Answer0">I see you have been thinking about something a lot lately, is everything okay?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Dialog0">Yes, everything is fine, I am thinking about one interesting task and want to test it in practice, but I have paws. Will you help me?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Dialog1">Thank you! Then take this two-meter stick and go measure the length of the shoreline of our pond. I am very interested in how much you measure.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage1Answer1">It will take me one day, I will report the results tomorrow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage3Answer0">Hi, I measured the length of the coast - it was 4.76 kilometers, what is next?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage3Dialog0">Very good, very good. Let us write it down - 4.76 kilometers. Now take this smaller ruler and do the same.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage3Answer1">Okay, I will be back tomorrow with the results.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage5Answer0">So, the survey is complete and some kind of devilry is going on there. This time the length of the coast was 5.12 kilometers. How so?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage5Dialog0">That, my dear, is the paradox of the coastline. If you want to know more about it, ask the bobers, they are good not only at carpentry, but also at mathematics.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage5Answer1">That is what I will do.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage6Answer0">Hi, frogus said you could explain the coastline paradox to me.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage6Dialog0">Aaaah, paradoks linii brzegowej? Wiemy, wiemy. Mam o tym bardzo ciekawą książkę. Przeczytaj ją, jest w niej mnóstwo ciekawych rzeczy.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFractalStage6Answer1">Thank you very much, I think I will master it overnight.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Answer0">Hey, my head is been buzzing with all sorts of thoughts lately. How do you always stay so rested?</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Dialog0">Ah, well, we Doguses have been learning meditation since childhood. Do you want me to teach you?</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Dialog1">To achieve enlightenment, do this:\n1. Get a Frogus - they know everything there is to know about meditation.\n2. As soon as it hatches, start practicing with it right away.\n3. Practice meditating with it every day.\n4. If you miss even one day, start over.\n5. Finishing 13 exercises will allow you to achieve enlightenment.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage1Answer1">It sounds confusing, but I will try.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Answer0">Hi, dogus said you can teach me meditation.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Dialog0">Great, you have come to the right place. Let us start with something simple – breathing exercises. Repeat after me.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Dialog1">Sorry, but you are a bit late, you need to find a younger Frogus.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage2Dialog2">[Half an hour later] Well, that is great, come tomorrow, we will continue training.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Answer0">Hi, I came to continue our training.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog0">You came too early, not even a day has passed since our last training, rest for now.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog1">Excellent! I see you are rested and ready to continue. Exercise for today is</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog2">Unfortunately, you are more than two days late. That is not how things work. We will have to start all over again.</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Answer1">Oh, oh, what can you do...</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Dialog4">I have nothing more to teach you, child, you already know everything you need to know. From now on, you can free yourself from the thoughts that bother you at will. Congratulations!</string>
	<string name="MeditationStage3Answer2">Thank you for spending time with me! I have learned a lot.</string>

	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage0">Something tells me that I need to make sure I understand catus properly.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage1">Great, now I need to ask catus, maybe someone needs some help.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage2">As I thought, one of the katus asked me to diversify the menu and find some fish somewhere. I will look for it near the pond he was talking about.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage3">Well, I caught some fish, I should give it to the catus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage4">Catus was pleased with my offering and said that he would go to the pond himself and evaluate its potential.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage5">I should probably ask Catus about his assessment of the pond.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFrogusStage6">Well, the pond assessment turned out to be very successful, he even found a Frogus egg, which I am incredibly happy about.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand my pets.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage1">Here comes another beautiful day.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage2">Nothing foreshadows trouble.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage3">Oh no! Someone dug up the grave without the consent of the deceased’s closest relatives! I need to ask around, maybe someone knows something.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage4">Dogus asked me to bring something from the grave so that he could begin his search.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage5">I found a piece of fabric, I need to show it to the dogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage6">Dogus said that he would try to follow the trail.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage7">I should ask the dogus if he found anything.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage8">I learned that catus are knowledgeable in magic. And the longer they live, the better they understand it. Perhaps one of them can help me with this mysterious book.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage9Use">The old catus told me that the book that dogus found was the Necronomicon. He also warned me that it was a very dangerous book. However, I decided to ignore him and wanted to learn the knowledge that this book contains. It seems that now I can resurrect the dead.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescNecronomiconStage9Destroy">The old katus told me that the book that the dogus found was the Necronomicon. He also warned me that it was a very dangerous book. Taking his advice, I decided to destroy the book. To be on the safe side.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand my pets.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage1">The eggs are gone! The eggs are gone! What should I do?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage2">I will ask the pets, maybe they know something.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage3">Dogus agreed to look for the eggs and said to give him a day to do it.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage4">It seems it’s time to ask the dogus about the results of his search.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage5">Dogus successfully returned the eggs to their place, now nothing will happen to them.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage6">The eggs are gone again! What the hell is going on! Maybe someone else can help me?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage7">Dogus agreed to help me again and told me to think about solving the problem in the future.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage8">Perhaps it’s time to ask the dogus about the search results again.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage9">Dogus put all the eggs back in place. I really should ask the other pets to help me with this.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage10">Frogus said that he would ask his friends from the pond, he said that they are handy and know their business.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage11">It’s time to ask frogus if there is any news from his friends.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainBoberStage12">Wow! These Bober guys not only gave me a basket for eggs, but they also entrusted me with one of their eggs so that I could care for future generations of bobers.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand my pets.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage1">I have noticed that lately the froguses have been sitting in thought for a long time, I need to figure out what is going on.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage2">Frogus asked me to measure the length of the pond shoreline using a two-meter stick. Why would he want that?</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage3">Well, I have measured it, it is time to report the results.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage4">Now frogus asked me to do the same thing, but with a different ruler.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage5">This time I measured a completely different number. Strange, I will go ask frogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage6">Frogus sent me to the bobers to find out about this paradox.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage7">Bober gave me a book about mathematics, I will dive into it head first.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescObtainFractalStage8">Wow, I learned a lot of new things there! What I liked most in this book were the fractals, now I know what they are and how different they are. I love imagining them!</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage0">To begin with, it would be nice to fully understand my pets.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage1">My head is been spinning lately. I will ask the adult dogus how he always manages to stay so rested.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage2">Dogus told me to ask Frogus about meditation.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage3">We started intensive training with Frogus.</string>
	<string name="QuestDescMeditationStage4">I learned meditation practices and now I can forget anything I want!</string>
