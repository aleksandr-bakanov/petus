	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog0">Look, I have found this strange book on ritual site. Take it.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7AnswerOption0">Thanks, do you know who can help me with it?</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog1">Try to ask catus they usually more experienced in wisdom stuff, the older the better.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage7DogDialog2">One more thing, at the same ritual site I have found the body of the lost pet. Poor guy. Do not worry I will return him back to his grave.</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8AnswerOption0">[Show the book] Do you know anything about this book?</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8Dialog0">What is this? I can sense some magic but I am not sure…</string>
	<string name="NecronomiconStage8Dialog1">Ahh, yes, I know what it is. This is Necronomicon. Very dangerous stuff, I recommend to destroy it right away, nothing good will come from it. However I can also teach you how to use it. Your choice. So do you want to use it or destroy it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer0">Hey buddy, I have noticed you barely touch your food, what is going on?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Dialog0">Yeah, you know what, I think I want some fish, could you catch me some? There is a lake nearby I think you can try there.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage1Answer1">All right, let us see what I can do. I think I will come up with something on next day.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer0">Oi mate, here is fish you have asked for. From very same lake you described.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Dialog0">Cheers mate, that is what I am talking about! Real fresh fish, el belissimo! Now I know this lake is good, think I will spend some time there by myself. Thanks again!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage3Answer1">No problem!</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer0">Hey, what is that you are playing with?</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Dialog0">Ah, found it on the lake. Round and rolling! Also smells like slime but it is okay. Here, take it, I am done playing with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainFrogusStage5Answer1">Thank you, I think I know what to do with it.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer0">Hey, do you know where all the eggs went?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog0">Wow! I do not know anything about this, but I can look for it, ask me tomorrow, maybe I will find something.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Dialog1">I do not know anything and, honestly, I do not care.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage2Answer1">Thank you, I will come see you tomorrow!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Answer0">Well, did you find anything?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage3Dialog0">Nope, still looking.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage4Dialog0">Aha, I found all the eggs, well, you made me run! I suspect that they just rolled away or maybe the wind blew them away, I put them back in place, now they definitely will not roll away.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Answer0">The eggs are missing again, do you know anything about it?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog0">What, again? Oh my! Okay, I will look again, but after I find it, you better come up with something so that this does not happen again.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage6Dialog1">Ahahahahahahahaha! Seriously? Well, screw them.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Dialog0">Here they are, finally. Listen, I do not want to run around looking for the missing eggs again if something else happens to them. Ask someone else, maybe they can help, we need to solve this problem somehow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage8Answer0">Okay, I will ask around.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Answer0">Maybe you know what to do with these constantly rolling eggs?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog0">Hmm, I do not know how to help you with this, but I think I know someone who knows what to do. My friends from the pond, handy guys. I will ask them, come see me tomorrow.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog1">I told you to ask someone else, do we all look the same to you?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage9Dialog2">Well, do I look like someone who can control the wind?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Answer0">Well, have you heard from your friends?</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage10Dialog0">They said they would do everything in the best possible way, wait a little longer.</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Dialog0">Yes! Look what they just sent us - a beautiful, reliable basket for storing eggs (with a lid). And along with the basket they sent a Bober egg - lucky!</string>
	<string name="ObtainBoberStage11Answer0">Truly a stroke of luck! I will have to try and hatch one or two.</string>
